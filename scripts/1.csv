                People who know me know that I'm not a fan of episodic anime series unless they're either one season (12-14 episodes) long or a slice of life series. Why? They have a tendency to get boring, or repetitive. But all rules and preferences have exceptions. You know what? Cowboy Bebop is that exception.
The story is set in a space western setting - a genre and setting I'm loving more and more for each show I watch that falls under the genre. We follow two bounty hunters, Spike and Jet, who own a ship called the Bebop. They travel the Solar system, chasing wanted criminals to
                  earn money. Along the way, they also pick up two women; the debt-laden Faye Valentine and the playful kid and computer genius Edward (yes, Ed&rsquo;s a girl). 
Each episode brings about a new bounty which they chase after, and while that doesn't sound too exciting to watch 26 episodes in a row, you'll end up loving the show. All the different events makes for a certain degree of unpredictability, and you'll sometimes wonder how things will end. However, that alone is not enough to give the story the rating I've given it. So why have I given that rating? Let's continue...
One of the things that elevate the show a bit above the rest is the manner in which the main cast's pasts are explored. It's not like one flashback episode and you understand everything about how they are today. In one episode you might get one piece, and then the next one in another episode, and it's not until the final three episodes of the show that everything falls in place. This way of executing it makes you want to watch another episode, so that you can find out more about the characters (some may say that this falls in under &quot;Character&quot;, but the manner in which the pasts are explored are more &quot;Story&quot; than &quot;Character&quot;, IMO). Now, that's so far a 9 for the story. Why did it deserve a 10?
The answer is easy: the way they executed many scenes in the show. The contrasts which you get to see between, music, the setting of scenes and what's really happening just gives the story that extra edge deserving of a perfect score.
The characters are all really good and interesting fellows. Though they every now and then reminded me of characters from other shows, they preserved that originality which gave a feel that they were, if not completely, then at least a little bit more real than most characters out there. The way their pasts intertwine with the future and how everything ends with them confronting and settling open ends from their pasts is also something that's impressive to watch. I don't really have anything more to say than &quot;perfect&quot;.
The animation is, for a 90s anime, stunningly good. The detail put into backgrounds and surroundings is really good, and I also love how good lighting effects and shading are at times. All of Ed&rsquo;s strange movements are animated really nicely too. If there's something negative, it's the somewhat dull coloring (compared to today's standards), as well as poor effects when traveling in hyperspace.
The soundtrack is also astounding! The music used for the show is so incredibly varied, and while keeping mostly to the more jazzy tunes, the soundtrack visits so many genres that it's hard to not like at least a few pieces. What I also loved is the way the music was used not only as a medium to go with and amplify the mood, but also as a contrast to what's happening in several scenes. All in all, it's really amazing. Don't have anything to say against voice acting and other sound effects either.
All in all Cowboy Bebop is an anime that&rsquo;s in the top tier on the greatness scale, and a show I believe every anime fan should give a try.

                Cowboy Bebop is one of those series that is just impossible to criticize. Not because it has no flaws, but because it has rabid fans who will defend it to the death. It has obtained the mythical “classic armor,” which is an abhorrent carte blanche, bestowed upon only the most overrated of anime, that is used to automatically defend against any sort of legitimate criticism. Cowboy Bebop certainly has good qualities, and it is relevant in how it influenced western perception of anime, but it wasn't quite groundbreaking or revolutionary in and of itself. You could argue that its audiovisuals were in fact groundbreaking, but
                  I think a work needs more than superficial qualities to be truly revolutionary or great.
Cowboy bebop borrows much from western media and pop culture in general. his show pays homage to or references, subtly and overtly, things as disparate as Antonio Banderas, Bruce Lee, John Woo, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Convoy, Biggie Smalls, Donald Duck, various mythologies and folktales, The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, Bill Evans, Stray Cats, Alien, blaxploitation films, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Queen, George Clooney, Led Zeppelin, Django and other spaghetti westerns, Herbie Hancock, American and Japanese professional baseball, Yellow Magic Orchestra, Jean-Luc Godard, Batman,  B.B. King, Beverly Hills 90210, John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, The Unabomber, Heaven's Gate and Marshall Applewhite, Kiss, film noir, The Beatles, Sleeping Beauty, Bonny & Clyde, Ziggy Stardust, Charlie Parker, Woody Allen, Star Trek, Cool Hand Luke, and Taxi Driver. I kid you not. And that's not a complete list. References in character design and dialogue are forgivable, but when it straight up copies scenes and plots then I think it can be held against the show. I feel like I've seen Cowboy Bebop before, it's just been packed into a pretty package. I enjoyed a lot of these homages, but that does not excuse the marked lack of creativity. The mere evocation of a masterpiece does not make a masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino is an example of someone who uses pastiche and cultural references well, and most importantly, his references and homages don't make up his entire videography. There is far too little originality in Cowboy Bebop. 
The fact is that Cowboy Bebop is the epitome of style over substance. I can appreciate it for its audiovisuals, but, to me, a show needs more than that to be a true masterpiece. Make no mistake though, it does have some of the best audiovisuals I've ever seen, and could arguably be considered a must-watch for that alone. The OST is good (despite also being a tad overrated,) the art is great, and the animation is extremely fluid. It should also be noted that Cowboy Bebop is one of the few anime that holds the distinction of having an English dub superior to the original Japanese. The atmosphere that the audiovisuals achieve is their greatest quality, and is distinct in almost every different setting. This is not done well in most space travel anime, and I have to applaud Cowboy Bebop for that achievement at least. 
The main storyline consists of about 5 episodes, the rest of them being episodic individual stories. This wouldn't be a huge problem, but the episodic stories were hit or miss, and they never measured up to the main plot. Some of the non-main episodes focus on a character and their past, and this is good, but most of them are completely pointless and could be removed without anybody noticing. One of them was about fighting an alien-fungus-fridge-monster, it was an interesting and silly parody of Alien, but it contributed nothing to plot or character development. Considering how character driven this show is, that's a problem. There was also an entire episode paying homage to blaxploitation. Seeing as the allusion was presented in a more original way, and the episode showed a lot about Ed's character, that one was not only forgivable, but it was one of my favorite episodes. Like I said, hit or miss. There is an episode about catching a super-dog. There is an episode about a virus that turns people into monkeys. There is an episode where they chase a bomber (Woody Allen) with some help from a transsexual looking trucker. At least 4 episodes were easily 10s, but more of them were closer to 5s. The first 4 episodes were particularly weak, which is a huge problem in a 2 cour anime. The anime may have had a good conclusion, but the sub-par exposition cannot be ignored. 
The main crew was made up of interesting and entertaining characters, and they prevented the episodic nature of the show from being a complete flop, although there were some unanswered questions about Faye's past in particular. Actually, strangely enough, the unanswered questions contributed to the splendid atmosphere. Everything had a rich backstory, but few flashbacks and no infodumps. This helped give the show its characteristic nostalgic atmosphere. One complaint I would have is that the main antagonist is simply not compelling, his motivations are somewhat unclear, and he's just one dimensional. He also uses a katana, even though it’s the future, and somehow still manages to kick ass. He’s just very cliché and lame. The antagonist in the movie was very well done with his depth, motives, and parallels to Spike, and that makes me wish Vicious got the same treatment, as it would fit his character far better, and his character is far more important. 
One thing you should understand is that the characters are often good examples of clichés done well. Jet, for instance, is the typical hard-boiled former cop, but he is also the most empathetic of the crew. He is a foil to Spike and is hard working, but they also parallel in many ways. Ed is the teen genius/tomboy and hacker with little depth, but she also serves as a foil to Spike and many of his views on life. Faye is like a mix of all of the other characters' worst traits in terms of personality, but she still manages to be a sympathetic character. In fact, even though she keeps up her unpleasant exterior and despite her being the anime's main source of fanservice, she arguably experiences more development than any other character. Still, they lack any sort of real innovation, in anime or otherwise.
Despite all my criticisms, Cowboy Bebop is cool. It's very cool. The characters and aesthetics were compelling (for the most part) to the point where I even enjoyed some of the admittedly weaker episodes. I can't give it a 10, it's simply not a masterpiece. I can't give it a 9, it's not truly great. I can't give it an 8, it's too flawed and unoriginal. I don’t want to give it a 7, it was just too inconsistent. I have to settle on a 6.7 or so, which could be rounded either way. That said, an average of my story, art, sound, and character scores did give me around a 7.2. 
Cowboy Bebop is enjoyable and it has wide appeal; I would probably recommend it to just about anybody. It was up and down in terms of quality, and it was similar to a slice-of-life in its episodic and relaxed nature and its lack of an explosive climax, but it was good. I liked how the anime takes place after the ""important part"" of the main characters' lives is over, and nostalgia becomes a huge theme, seeing as it was the first anime I ever watched and it thus evokes a huge sense of nostalgia for me anyway. I loved the laid back atmosphere. The problem is that after looking through all of the episodes and rating them individually, I realized that the majority of it was nothing special. With a little restraint and reworking, Cowboy Bebop could have been the masterpiece that it is widely regarded as, and it does hold a special place in my heart regardless, even if that is only due to it being my first anime. That bias is probably why I choose to round the score to 7, rather than to 6, despite the fact that the latter is typically the better practice. 
I am always willing to defend and justify my scores so leave me a comment if you disagree, and tell me why I’m wrong. I say that because this does seem to be a pretty uncommon score, even among those whose opinions I have great respect for. Keep in mind that a 7 is a generous and good score in any case.",7,Polyphemus,

                Cowboy Bebop was originally an anime series created by Shinichiro Watanabe in 1998. It consists of 26 episodes, a mini-sode, and a theatrical movie. It was released in America in 2001, and is one of the few anime franchises to be more successful in North America than in its native Japan. I have seen the 26 tv episodes and the movie. I already know what a lot of you are doing right now after glancing at the numerical score I gave; you're hitting up the comment box on my profile and writing these exact words:
""Fuck you! Cowboy Bebop is a classic! You're not allowed to
                  criticize it!""
The more astute viewers will note that I scored the series a 6, but the movie a 9. I kind of like Cowboy Bebop. It does do some things very right. It had the potential to be one of the greatest franchises ever. Alas, while its production values are unmatched, the writing . . . doesn't always match up with the production. Because of this, the series ended up being a style-over-substance experience for me, but why was that?
The premise of CB is that in the late 21st century, mankind has started living in places in the solar system besides Earth. In this future are bounty hunters known as Cowboys. Cowboys do whatever they can to make cash to keep the food stockpile stocked and their spaceships running. The show follows one such group of Cowboys who pilot a ship called the Bebop. In the beginning, we meet Spike Spiegel, a former gangster, and Jet Black, a former cop. As the series progresses, the Bebop also has Ein, a super smart dog, Faye Valentine, a woman on the run, and Edward, a really, really, REALLY weird hacker girl. Cowboy Bebop has been described as a series that has a continuous plot, and has standalone episodes at the same time. Having seen the series, I can tell you that technically, most of the episodes aren't standalone, but many of them are only connected by the core characters.
Here's where one of my problems lie. When Cowboy Bebop is good, it's really good. The setting is very mature; it never condescends to the audience. The action scenes are superbly well done, the dialog is believable (though cheesy at times), and the atmosphere really pulls you in. How many episodes are actually really good? Seven. If you count the movie as an episode, that brings it up to eight. Eight out of twenty-seven episodes were good. The rest were not.
The problem with most of the episodes is one of two things: one, it's really boring, or, two, it's so clichéd, you will be able to predict exactly what happens by the end after the first two minutes, or both. I have to be honest, a lot of the episodes of CB are just plain boring. If this wasn't a ""classic"" and a more ordinary anime series, a lot of them would be branded as what they truly are; filler episodes. And if it's not boring filler, it's hackneyed.
Watanabe is known for being a huge fan of American cinema, and that's obvious in CB. Unfortunately, he ripped off a lot of American movies virtually piecemeal. Now, you may not suspect it, but I am more knowledgeable of American cinema than I am Japanese animation. To describe it as best I can without spoiling, if you have seen at least one movie directed by Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, John Woo, and Michael Mann, then you have already seen Cowboy Bebop in another format. This is actually a clever trick though; most anime fans reject Western pop culture, and may not notice this when watching CB, so they'll think it's ""fresh"" and ""original"", when it's fact, it's actually MORE clichéd then most anime. But hey, when CB is exciting and isn't (too) blatantly ripping off Hollywood, it's worth watching.
At least, when the worthwhile characters are onscreen. I like the main character Spike a lot. He is the embodiment of cool, like a 21st century version of Steve McQueen. He's cool, but he's very human too. He's reckless, he makes mistakes, but he knows how to charm people, and he also knows how to beat his targets. I also like Jet. He's a constant worrywart, which is a funny contrast to his rough appearance. Some of the incidental characters are memorable too, (but usually only in the good episodes and movie). Something else I liked was the Bebop crew was not always a stable group, or nakama you could say. In most anime, when the heroes band together, nothing ever separates them. That doesn't happen in CB. Sometimes, the crew gets in arguments, and sometimes, one of them will leave the Bebop for a time, and so on. It's a touch of realism I appreciate.
However, some of the characters didn't click with me. I never really cared for Faye. I don't dislike her, but I don't really care for her either. Edward is amusing, but she feels out of place in a series like this. The incidental characters in the less memorable episodes are just that, unmemorable. However, what I'm about to print in the next paragraph will anger thousands, possibly millions. (And maybe make hundreds say ""Right on!"") Mind you, it's just my opinion. Everything I print in these reviews is just my opinion; you don't have to take it personally, but the following opinion of mine needs to be said:
Vicious is one of the lamest villains ever.
The main antagonist is a man known as Vicious, someone who's still a part of the gang Spike came from. He's cunning, ruthless . . . and is absolutely lame. What's his motive? Does he just want power, or to mess with people? Even if so, why is he so boring to watch? The villain from the movie was a lot more interesting. Overall, you got two really good protagonists, some interesting chemistry between the protagonists, one-shot characters who are either interesting or not, and a forgettable antagonist. Yay.
And I haven't even touched upon the ending yet! Short version, I don't like CB's ending. (More flames incoming! Duck and cover!) Now, the ending is not quite as bad as the ending for, say, Akira, or the anime version of Chobits. It does have a sense of finality to it, something most anime endings don't have. However, I did not find it ""legendary."" I found it disappointing. First of all, the ending is extremely predictable. It's virtually telegraphed to you before it even happens. Not only that, when I saw it, my reaction was, "" . . . that's it? Seriously, that's IT?""
But I better move on to CB's technical aspects before I get too letdown. Its artistry leaves no complaints. CB is probably the best-looking pre-digital anime I've ever seen. Even if you were to remake the series with digital enhancements, I doubt you could make it look better than it already is. Sumptuous backgrounds, top-notch character art, animation that ranges from above-average to really good, no off-model shots, this is a visual feast. The movie looks even better. It's obvious a lot of care was put into the visuals of CB. My only being the primitive CGI, but you get used to it.
And now we touch upon CB's greatest aspect; its soundtrack. It's the sort of the soundtrack that makes you go, ""Ah yeah, baby!"" This is why you watch CB, the music. The music is the magnum opus of Yoko Kanno. A combination of jazz, blues, and rock, but it isn't just any old jazz, blues, and rock, it's GOOD jazz, blues, and rock. Everything from the opening, to the incidental music, to the endings, you get music that will set your soul on fire. The only anime I've seen whose soundtrack could rival CB's is Death Note's. Something I noticed about CB's soundtrack is the music sounds more like music from albums rather than typical soundtrack music. Another smart move; most people are accustomed to listening to music from CD and MP3 albums as opposed to soundtracks, so when they hear CB's music, it'll be more familiar-sounding than most other anime soundtracks. Regardless, even if you hate CB, you gotta score this music.
CB is also famous for having what is perhaps the oldest English dub for an anime series that is considered god-like. I saw this on Adult Swim, and I can safely say, this is another masterpiece from Bandai and Bang Zoom. Every character sounds like how you would imagine them to, and the voices are neither wooden nor over-acted. All the different accents the characters have sound really cool too. I did sample the Japanese dub on the movie, and I will say, Spike and Jet sound really good in both Japanese and English, but I will never get used to Faye's Japanese voice. Yeah, this is one you gotta see in English. (Though in retrospect, the Japanese performances aren't bad, it just doesn't click like the English dub)
While CB is still often regarded as a classic, I'm not the first to criticize it like so. There has been some backlash against CB in recent years. Some people complain it's not ""Japanese-y"" enough, that it's too Western. I mentioned that earlier, but there is another anime I've seen, Baccano, which is also very similar to American movies, but it was consistently entertaining, and not as predictable as CB, so I did not mind. Others have mentioned the same things I have, that it's boring, the plot isn't strong enough, it's style over substance. This isn't a disaster by any means, but I do have to say that, outside of the production values, CB is one of the most overrated anime I've seen. It's not one of the worst, certainly not, but it's not quite the experience I was promised either. To put it in other words, there were some episodes that I would score a 4 out of 10. And yet, there are some episodes, including the movie, that I would score a 9 out of 10. The 6 overall is just from mixing the good episodes with the bad.
I like to imagine that in an alternate dimension, CB was an OVA series instead of a tv series. All the episodes I do like, (# 2, 8, 12, 13, 17, 20, and 22) were released on separate OVAs, as well as a few others to bridge the plot gaps. Then a theatrical came out (Knocking on Heaven's Door), and then another to end it all (The Real Folk Blues, albeit with a revised conclusion), and it would be grandiose. Alas, I don't live in that universe. Hey, Shinichiro Watanabe likes drawing influence from Hollywood, right? What's something it's doing a lot of right now? Continuity reboots? He could still do that. I can dream, can't I?
EDIT: This review was revised on 9/17/2015 to be less awkward to read.",6,xm0123,

                Only a few anime series or movies could be considered true classics, and one of the most notable shows to fall into this category is iconic not just for its style, design and animation, but also for the depth of its characters and its music.
That anime is Cowboy Bebop.
Story
Cowboy Bebop is told as a series of standalone episodes, each of which is only really connected to one another by the characters, with very few of them directly following on from one another. This method of storytelling is now termed as &ldquo;episodic&rdquo;, and while the format is now commonplace in anime, this series set the standard
                  in its usage, and many purists believe it to be almost flawless in its execution of this storytelling style. 
Sunrise, the production company behind the show, used this format as a tool to develop the characters in the show, and whilst many episodes are unique in terms of story content and plot, there is a strong connection to the rest of the series due to the strength of the characters, something which also applies to the movie Knocking on Heaven&rsquo;s Door.
One of the big advantages to the show's storytelling method is that it allows the viewer to jump straight into the story at almost any point, however it should be noted that many shows that adopt the episodic format are often let down by poor character development. The fact that the series manages to develop its characters, and develop them well, is a testament to the strength of the individual episodes as standalone stories, and the personal history of each character (which becomes clearer as the series progresses). In essence, Cowboy Bebop is a more about the characters themselves and their relationships with each other, than it is about their &ldquo;adventures&rdquo;. There are a number of episodes where the viewer may feel a strong connection to the characters, their history,mannerisms, pet peeves, etc, something which is difficult enough to accomplish in a normal sequential story. Achieving this in an episodic story is a mark of the quality of the series.
Art/Animation
The animation in Cowboy Bebop is amongst the best seen in anime, and even though it is now over a decade old, it still manages to hold its own in terms of animation and character design with more modern action oriented shows. Sunrise, who generally do an excellent job on animation, really pushed the boat out with this series, and when compared with other shows that were released around the same time (Outlaw Star for example), it can clearly be seen that the art, animation and character design in Cowboy Bebop is something special. The animation during the numerous action sequences is especially impressive and the character movements are free-flowing and naturalistic.
The art, while not vibrant with flashy colours, portrays the feeling, attitude and environmental influences for the characters perfectly. The numerous locales which the crew of the Bebop visit are rendered in stunning detail, adding a surreal sense of realism to the show, whilst the character designs were a work of brilliance, and allows each character a mark of individuality even before they spoke.
Sound
The quality of the soundwork used in Cowboy Bebop is what really sets it apart from other anime series. The music was composed by the world renowned Yoko Kanno, and performed by The Seatbelts, a band specifically formed by Kanno to perform the music for the series. The music is a strange mix of blues, classic rock and jazz, and while at first this may seem an odd choice for a sci-fi series, the music works extremely well in the setting as it reflects the generally lackadaisical attitude adopted by the crew of the Bebop. Even today, the soundtrack for this anime is unique in terms of style and composition. The opening theme, Tank!, has become one of the most influential pieces in anime history, and one of the few anime based music tracks to be appreciated by music lovers with no background in anime or manga.
The sound effects in the series are also well done. The various locations are vibrant with background noises, from the hum of the Bebop's engines and the sound of gulls by the sea, to the hubbub of a crowded street. The many gunshots and explosions are clear and sound almost as though you're standing right in the middle of the wild gun battles. 
Whilst the Japanese voice actors do an excellent job with each of the four main characters, this is one of the rare anime shows out there where many prefer the English cast over the original Japanese. Cowboy Bebop is one of the few anime in existence where the English dub is equal to, if not better than, the original Japanese version.
Characters
Cowboy Bebop has some of the most original and memorable characters to appear in anime. Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed are four of the most enigmatic individuals to found in the medium, and upon seeing them, the viewer will probably wonder how they work together when all of them come from diversely different backgrounds with opinions that clash with one another. 
Spike and Jet are most definitely &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; of sci-fi anime, or indeed any genre of anime you care to name. Their conflicting personalities bounce off each other like peas on a drum, and once Faye is added to the mix it becomes a potent brew of character interaction. It is through this interaction that the viewer is more able to empathise with each character, and the slow but steady revelations about their pasts, told wonderfully through flashbacks and reunions, have far greater impact because of this empathy. The characters are so well defined that many scenes which would normally appear mundane in other anime are just as memorable in this series as the action scenes (one springs to mind - Spike and Jet eating eggs after Faye, Ed and Ein leave the ship).
Enjoyment 
Cowboy Bebop is a sci-fi western with equal parts humour and seriousness, and is already considered by many within the anime community to be a classic. There is a level of sophistication in both the story and its characters that is rare for a show, regardless of whether it is an anime or not. The great cast, the heavy drama tempered with bouts of comedy, the excellent music, all serve to cement its place in the hearts and minds of anime fans the world over. It is a testament to its quality that there is only one show, anime or otherwise, that can be held up as a fair comparison (Joss Whedon&rsquo;s Firefly). This is considered by many to be a &ldquo;must-see&rdquo; series as it is a testament to what can be achieved in anime with the right ingredients. 
The only downside to this anime would be the lack of a continuous story. Because of this, the series lacks the &quot;epic saga&quot; feel upon which many sci-fi stories are judged. However, the depth of each character, together with the strength of their individual stories, is more than enough to carry this series.

                Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime that truly impressed me. 
One of the first anime that convinced me the anime genre as a whole had something going for it, that anime has qualities that separate it from other forms of entertainment.
It is a show that has withstood the test of time and is often viewed as a masterpiece by many. With such popularity and praise there is bound to be a group of the opposite extreme that dislike the show. Now I bear in my mind that although this group is a minority their points are valid. As a reviewer I look at
                  all angles and try my best to keep bias at an all time low.
Having said that, regardless of my attempts to locate the flaws of this show my overall consensus is that Cowboy Bebop is in multiple ways a masterpiece.
Here Goes The Review (Spoilers are at a Minimum)
Story~9.5
When most people think about what society would be like by the time space exploration is achieved they imagine a society that is more organized, coherent, and advanced. This is one of the key misconceptions that cause Cowboy Bebop’s story to shine.
We start our episodic space journey in an environment that is futuristic yet in many ways primitive. Watanabe Shinichiro’s depiction of the Cowboy Bebop universe seamlessly fuses the attitudes and tensions of a western shooter with the atmosphere of vast unexplored space. Due to the inability of the police to handle all criminals in such a large area bounty hunting is encouraged through media. Our four main characters (discussed more in the character section) just so happen to be bounty hunters that are all unwillingly bound together by greed, revenge, coincidence, and or desire. Furthermore, little to no background information is given about any of the characters from the beginning. Each character has a past that is hinted throughout many episodes. Slowly, the audience learns of the sins, misfortunes, and tragedies that quietly haunt those aboard the spaceship of Bebop.
And so this is the world us, the viewers, are thrust into and what an amazingly unique barren world it is. Being for the most part episodic, viewers may be deterred by the looseness and seemingly pointlessness of certain episodes. Be aware that although episodic, each episode develops the characters and is key to forming the bonds that will ultimately culminate the multiple climaxes of the story.
Art~9.5
Do not let age fool you. Despite being over a decade and a half old the animations in Cowboy Bebop are amazing in providing the dangerous rugged environment of criminal filled space. In fact, the 1998 art is more of a positive than a negative. Gone are the crisp saturated art of modern day. The outdated animations contribute greatly to the classy western style of the anime. Everything from the smoke of cigarettes to guns ablazing are portrayed brilliantly. The choreography of martial arts and space flight is done in a fluid and smooth fashion. The characters look great and production never seems to dip for a single moment.
Three simple words can summarize the art: Rugged yet Classy~
And so in trying my absolute best to pinpoint the flaws of the art I am both reluctant and glad to announce that I have failed in doing so. Cowboy Bebop’s art is amazingly well done even for today’s standards. Knowing in the back of your head that this art originates from 1998 is just icing on the cake.
Sound~10
Earlier in my review I talked about how with much praise and popularity ultimately spawns a group with ideals of the opposite extreme. I wholeheartedly believe that it is safe to say that regardless of your ideas about Cowboy Bebop, everyone can agree that the music in this anime is absolutely amazing. So amazing that without the music I believe that Cowboy Bebop would never have achieved the success it has had to this day.
Never have I come across another example such as Cowboy Bebop where the music is such an integral part of the show.
From the Blues riffs of slide guitars to the unmatched soul of harmonica solos, the music in Cowboy Bebop does its job 110%. To say that the the music is fitting would be an understatement. Cowboy Bebop’s music boosts the atmosphere and situation of every scene to its highest potential and provides a convincing atmosphere like no other.
The dub of Cowboy Bebop is the arguably the most highly praised dub ever produced in the anime industry. Watanabe Shinichiro himself has even stated that he believed the English dub surpasses the Japanese dub, a feat that is notoriously rare. Every character’s voice is portrayed brilliantly with every word filled with real human emotion. Convincingly raw and powerful, I have yet to stumble across another instance where the voice acting was this well done. I honestly can not think up a single flaw of the voice acting even while keeping bias at a minimum. The English voice acting is truly a one of a kind in a world of horribly ear wrenching dubs.
The OP and the ED of Cowboy Bebop are probably one of the most popular Opening and Ending Themes of all time. The OP (""Tank!"" by The Seatbelts) is a jazzy explosion of adrenaline. Listening to it is a joy and pumps the viewer’s eagerness to watch the episode. It keeps you on your feet and is in many ways the most famous trademark of the Cowboy Bebop series. The ED for most of the show (""The Real Folk Blues"" by The Seatbelts feat. Mai Yamane) is equally as amazing but instead of pumping the viewer’s eagerness the ED in turn helps the viewer digest what was just displayed on the screen. Listening to the ED causes heartwarming scenes to be that much more heartwarming while heartbreaking scenes to be that much more heartbreaking. The Real Folk Blues is a beautiful jazzy blues inspired song sung over with Mai Yamane’s powerful voice. The ED only changes twice in the anime, each change being only for one episode. As a reviewer I would not feel right about spoiling the timing of the ED changes because they are in my opinion some of the most powerful moments of the anime. And so this last bit I shall let the viewer experience.
Character~10
Cowboy Bebop has one of the most memorable casts of any show I have ever watched. They are eccentric, unique, strong willed, and powerfully convincing.
We have Spike Spiegel who is a male bounty hunter in his late twenties that is trying to escape an inescapable past; Jet Black, the father like figure of the spaceship Bebop who has been stricken by unjust tragedies; Faye Valentine, the strong independent con artist who is kept in the dark about her own life; and last but not least Edward, the androgynous female teenage hacker with a background as confusing as herself. 
As mentioned earlier they are for the most part unwillingly bound together by greed, revenge, coincidence, and or desire. This is what is so great about the characters in Cowboy Bebop… they all start off the show hating each other!
The reluctant and slow change of their relationships is humorous,real, and convincing.
The climatic points of the show are the episodes in which bits and pieces of each crew member’s past is slowly revealed. We get to see and feel what they were hiding and the raw emotions that they feel. Each character is its own little mystery that keeps the audience in the dark. 
Easily the most impressive aspect of Cowboy Bebop is the portrayal of the characters. The crew deals with grief, anger, sadness, and all else in their own unique ways and rarely deviate. How Shinichiro portrays this uniqueness is simply amazing. The characters NEVER falter and always stay true to themselves. As the episodes roll by, the audience starts to understand why each character acts the way they do and can relate. This understanding makes it unbearably easy for the audience to become emotionally attached to each crew member as we share their pain and memories.
All in all, the characters of Cowboy Bebop are outstanding. Their strengths overcome their flaws when united as a whole. Beautifully drawn and creative, Shinichiro has invented a golden cast.

                Cowboy Bebop is an episodic series. By episodic, I mean that one episode doesn't necessarily lead or follow the next one. With that being said, don't expect a lot of ""plot"" in this series. You watch Cowboy Bebop for the characters, plain and simple. Spike, Faye, Jet, Ed, Ein are what make this anime arguably one of the most memorable series ever produced. The music is awesome (especially if you're a fan of Jazz), the animation is top notch (considering when the series came out), and the enjoyment value is second to none.
While a lot of people want that ""similar episode"" feel, if you're the
                  kind of person that enjoys a fast paced anime (with each character getting his or her own spotlight), this is for you. If you're not the type to enjoy fast paced, bounty huntin' fun, and rather you like deep thought provoking, dark, mysterious shows...don't watch Cowboy Bebop. Vicious (one of the characters) may be able to bring a little of that sinister side for you, but this isn't that kind of show.",10,Xinil,

                Cowboy Bebop has something that the anime world has seem to have forgotten in a coinpurse somewhere: balls.
I don't mean just any kind of balls. I mean huge, sweaty, hairy testicles that swing back and forth like wrecking balls at the sheer hint of thigh movement. The atom-slicing power of these balls could level Detroit in a single blow. I'm not talking about the steroid ravaged, ""mom where's the protein"" balls of TTGL or G Gundam either. Those are anime you put on right after you inject yourself with bull-shark testosterone and deadlift 440 lbs. No, the balls Cowboy Bebop slaps on the table are
                  of a different caliber; a different breed entirely, than the balls other anime, good and bad, have displayed in the past. They exude confidence without devolving into double-down, Long Island guido douchebaggery---they stand ice-cold in their manliness but aren't afraid to deliver one powerful scene after another. They aren't concerned with pretentious, Freudian mindfuckery, and they're past the ""edginess"" of gore, tits, and embarrassing profanity. There's no shitty gimmicks or pandering, and they don't let themselves fall victim to the stereotypes of what anime is supposed to be. Like Goku and Vegeta, or white people in Baltimore, they are the last of a dying breed.
Cowboy Bebop is an anime in the most basic sense of the word. In reality, it's a 26 episode, moving piece of artwork, taking influence from cultures in vastly different parts and time periods of the world. It's film noir, Chinatown style. It's The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, with Clint Eastwood's patented ice-cold asswhippery and Sergio Leone's masterful spaghetti western storytelling. It's 1930s New Orleans, Louisiana. It's Star Wars. It's Enter the Dragon. It's a culmination of the spiciest cultural influences from the far east to the shores of the west, and it's honestly the best experience with an anime you will ever have. Some people have a bone to pick with the episodic nature of the plot, but pay no mind to them. Each new episode is like a blank slate, individually developed and shaped into a unique piece; a miniature story that calls upon a fresh set of inspirations to give it a flavor all its own. The overarching plot of the show is subtle but existent; it draws upon all sorts of themes and motifs like love and revenge, and is quietly woven throughout the series until it finally takes precedence at the end. Despite this, the transition from standalone episodes to the overall story feels natural. Some shows force plot elements onto you like an American businessman on a young Filipino girl (ever see the second arc of Death Note?), but the progression here is cool Lester smooth. You can choose to take in the show however you want to---you can relish in the individual beauty of each episode or you can view the show as one coherent story, continually building off of itself. Either way, you end up with something that's completely genuine and one of a kind---there's no other anime like it.
While Cowboy Bebop isn't really associated with VIP quality artwork like it is with VIP quality soundtracks, Bebop has literally some of the best artwork in anime, ever. For some reason when you bring up the artwork from any pre-2000s anime, people get all condescending, like anything released before 2001 was drawn completely in purple crayon by Ms. Johnson's 8:30 AM kindergarten class. I've lost count of how many times I've heard stunning 90s animation cut down as ""dated"" by people that praise the emotionless, passionless digital animation of today. If anyone ever tells you Bebop's art is anything less than outstanding, punch them in the uterus for me. The animation is spectacular---the movement is surprisingly natural and the action is fluid. Watch a few of the fight scenes and you'll see why the creative staff of Naruto were reduced to ripping off one from the Cowboy Bebop movie, frame for frame. A lot of the character designs did away with traditional anime characteristics: bodies are proportional, even going so far as to downsize their usually massive eyes to a smaller, more manageable scale. The designs themselves are a treat to look at, and they fit the personalities of the characters pretty solidly. The action scenes themselves are varied, ranging the gauntlets from fistfights to dogfights and everything in between. If you don't think watching losers getting their shit wrecked is awesome, you will by the end of this show. Fuck, even the CG is good, if a little rough. The amount of detail Sunrise put into the animation is just, totally astonishing---even with the technological advancements of today it still takes a dump all over most of the artwork that's been put out in the past decade or so.
Now, again, Cowboy Bebop is associated primarily with its soundtrack. There's a particularly good reason for this, and it's because it's literally the best soundtrack you'll ever hear. While most anime, especially today, resort to typical gutter trash j-pop, the music of Bebop is an ensemble of jazz, blues, classical, funk, rock, with a little pop and even a little heavy metal. You get a nice introduction to what's in store from the OP---Tank is a kick in the ass and its only amplified by what's probably the best opening in all of anime. After an entire episode of fucking outrageous tracks, you close with The Real Folk Blues which is beautiful and totally melancholy. You will want to own every OST by the end of the show; other shows might have good music but I don't think I've ever seen a show with a soundtrack that's just as good if listened to like a regular old album. From Space Lion to Ask DNA, Yoko Kanno constantly hits it out of the park, and without her Bebop wouldn't have that signature vibe it's so well known for.
Also, the English dub is the best dub ever made. Period. If you watch this subbed you might as well kick yourself in the balls and set your computer on fire because you're depriving yourself of what is some of the best voice acting anime has ever seen. As much as I respect the Japanese voice actors and don't want to minimize their work, I don't even know what the hell they sound like because the dub is that fucking good. Trust me, even if you spit on dubs like they're a woman on the Maury show or a degree from ITT Tech, you need to give this one a chance. There is no weak link among the voice actors; every voice fits its character perfectly---every performance is Oscar worthy in its own right. It's honestly god-tier.
As for the characters, well, without them the show is nothing. Literally, the characters make this show. If you swapped them out for any other cast, the result would be a vastly inferior series about a group of douchebags on a gay spaceship who hang around shitholes and fuck with losers all day. Instead, what we're given is probably one of the most dramatic and artistic character pieces ever put to film. Each character feels like a living, breathing person, with their own faults and imperfections and checkered pasts. They don't just feel like plot devices for carrying a story along. The way they interact with each other and grow as people throughout all their exploits feels authentic and real, and their development over time is part of what makes Bebop so classic. Like real people, they constantly fight and bicker amongst one another but it's that bickering, and the experiences they have together, that draws them closer as a group. It's this approach to characterization that really pulls Bebop together as a whole---each character has their own story to tell and slowly, as you work your way through the series, you find out what those stories are. You have Spike, the smoothest, most ice cold motherfucker this side of the Milky Way, who brings a little humanity to the ""live life in the fast lane and kick a shit ton of asses while you do it"" lifestyle that he leads alongside his life partner Jet, who despite his ruggedness really serves as kind of a father figure to the group. Faye's past envelops her otherwise forward and strong personality, and Edward is just straight up goofy, but in an endearing way that actually makes you smile. Their trials and tribulations amongst each other and others from both their past and their present are entertaining, engrossing, and touching---again, without them, the show wouldn't be nearly what it is today.
I think the sheer quality and accessibility of this anime gives a lot of people the wrong idea, because I constantly see people recommending this as a great ""first anime"" for trying to get people into the medium. Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime I saw, but I think using it as an introduction sends people the wrong message about what they should expect from most of the anime they'll see. Cowboy Bebop is a pinnacle in visual entertainment precisely because it's able to shed the typical ""skin"" of an anime and develop into something much deeper and more culturally rich. There's a lot of great anime out there, and the more anime I watch the more of it I discover. But starting with something so dissimilar to the majority of what anime is will give people a skewed perception of what anime should be right from the start. I guess this is the only way to get some people to sit down and actually watch a cartoon, but for others you're setting them up for disappointment down the road.
Enjoyment? It's the best anime I've ever seen. That's the only way I can describe how I feel about it. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry (keyword you, I don't have tear ducts so I can't cry. Tragic accident, I don't want to talk about it). It'll make you think, it'll make you feel. It might give you a boner. It's untouchable. It's ice cold. It's a classic.

                Cowboy Bebop is, in effect, an episodic, slice of life sort of series revolving around our Space Cowboys (and girls) Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed. This review is here to tackle some points about the series I feel are worth mentioning, as I know it's all been said before.
Now Cowboy Bebop has it all; great characters with good backstories, smooth animation, amazing music and lots of humor. So why don't I love it? Quite simply, Cowboy Bebop was a frustrating experience for me! I watched the series on and off over a couple of months, far longer than it normally takes for me to finish
                  a series this short. I found it very off-putting that, with such interesting characters, the creators chose to spend so much time doing nothing with them! 
As others have mentioned, each episode is a hit or a miss. Some tackle the main characters, mix in some plot, throw in new characters or ideas and are just amazing overall. And then others are meandering and pointless. 
Now this is found in any slice-of-life series, it comes with the package. But in Cowboy Bebop it especially bothered me to spend an episode watching some character do something I could care less about when there are four amazing, interesting characters with stories that could fill several seasons sitting around and not getting anywhere! 
Vicious and Julia for example; why did we spend an episode watching Jet's old friend's daughter come to grips with her father's lack of affection for her? I honestly can't remember. And then you have Vicious and Julia's very few appearances despite being characters very important in the overall plot and intriguing characters in their own right.
So before you hit the non helpful button, please remember that I do hold the series in high regard. It is a very well-made series that raises many interesting questions and concepts; and while some episodes frustrated me, others fascinated me. There's nothing wrong with the series, and I know many people like it's meandering nature and enjoy the lack of an over-arching plot (which, by the way, was rather tidily summed up in two eps at the end, nicely done). 
While my objective opinion is that it is a well-made series, well worth a watch, my subjective view wishes it was different, that it had been a story about Spike's past, about Vicious, about their friendship, about Julia's love and Jet and Faye's stories as well. It is because I loved the characters so much that I wanted more of them, wanted to see them more, know them more.

                I think its quite saddening that I don't have anything better to do than writing a review. On christmas! However, this really needs to be done at some point, and while other people are eating cookies, I'll do this one: Cowboy Bebop Review Mk II. New and improved, rated by my new guidelines!
First of all, yes, I still dislike Cowboy Bebop, and even without rereading it I still remember the opening phrase from my first review. I'll refrain from it this time though, because at some point I stopped caring about whether I like that particular anime or not, I just want to give a
                  fair rating.
Story is for me defined by its Main Plot, the setting used, as well as the execution of the storyline.
First, for the main plot. The most episodes are without any relevance to the main plot. They neither help to develop the cast, nor do they illustrate the setting. They are filler. Nothing more, and nothing less. And to be perfectly honest, I don't think its a viable option to spam filler after filler without even explaining what the anime is about. When I first watched this anime I lost interest after a mere 3 episodes and dropped it (For reference, by now I watched this anime like 3 times only for review reasons). But without filler episodes, what is actually left? A story which couldn't be more cliche. A story of two former friends, who fell in love with the same woman.
Revenge, bloodlust... The usual stuff.
As for the setting: To be honest, I don't have the most experience with science fiction, but I feel like this is one of the worst tries. The Ring travel system doesn't make sense in the slightest, nor do the spaceships. The first thing that comes to mind is Spikes space ship, the SWORDFISH II wouldn't be able to even navigate in space. Much less in the atmosphere. Well, crash and burn, Spike. I guess.
Execution: I think I already mentioned that Fillers before the story isn't exactly the best way to hook the audience. As for the main story, I already said that it's a rather cliched one (everything beyond that would be spoiler). Well, you get the picture.
So overall: We have a B-Movie storyline, sprinkled with fillers (1/3), a logically flawed setting (1/3), and a rather bad execution which never hooked me up (1/3). Overall 4/10 for the story.
Next is the Artwork, which not just considers the Artworks for the characters, but also the background, as well as the fluency of animation (especially during battlescenes).
To be blunt, compared to other anime of that time Cowboy Bebops artworks aren't anything bad. They do their job just fine without being groundbreaking or breathtaking.
The backgrounds on the other hand are rather often undetailed, and I can even recall scenes in which parts of the screen were whited out (without being flashbacks). This leaves the animation, which is as always in Watanabes works, quite flashy, but only style and no substance. The choreography is pretty bad.
Summing it up: The character artworks are up to par (2/3), while the backgrounds and animation are quite lackluster (1/3 for both). Overall 5/10 for art.
For the sound I rate the voiceover (japanese dub only), as well as the OST/BGM, and the OP/ED. So, lets kick it off with the Voices. I don't really like the japanese cast, which, in my opinion, fail to express any feelings their characters might have. Without the video and subs I couldn't imagine whether the characters are sad, happy or whatever. Overall a pretty bad performance. The english cast on the other hand was pretty damn good, and I have to give credit to them, this is one of the best dubs I know. As for the OST I wondered why I couldn't remember even a single track. After rewatching an episode I knew: Because there is next to none OST most of the time. The few OSTs presented are more to underline the plot, but on their own don't really pack a punch. Lastly, the OP/ED Themes. I don't really like Blues to begin with, but I don't really feel like the theme fits Action-headhunter stuff too well. It felt more like some detective story or the like, at least to me. As for the ending 'The Real Folk Blues' fits way better and brings closure to each episode.
Final scores for sound: Bad japanese cast which produces no feelings (1/3), next to nonexistant OST with forgettable tracks (1/3), and a mediocre OP, but okay ED (1/3).
Sums up at 4/10 for sound.
Characters should preferably have some catchy initial designs, good relations with their surroundings, and a good development. which is why I rate characters in there 3 categories.
Initial designs: I don't think that Cowboy Bebop reinvented the wheel with their characters, but they fulfill their purpose. Jet as that cop who left the police to deliver justice on his own, the more or less sexy girl, and the easygoing main lead.
Unfortunately I never felt like they had any relations with each other. None of their interactions with each other, but also with the surroundings felt real to me, because basically they had no counterparts they could greatly argue with.
As for the development, quite honestly, I don't think that any of the characters had great development. Thinking bad I can't recall much of a development to begin with. The Spike from Episode 26 will act like the Spike from Episode 1. Or 4. Or which episode you want to choose.
Same goes for most other characters, with only Faye being the exception.
So overall the characters are rather disappointing, especially since they started with promising designs (2/3). But their Interaction was nonexistent (0/3), and the development was poor (1/3).
Overall 4/10 for the cast of Cowboy Bebop.
Enjoyment. Well, thats something everyone should decide for themselves. For me at least its a 1/10. Why? Because I answered these questions honestly:
How much did I like the seen episodes (0-3)?
How much do I want to see the story continue (0-3)?
Would I recommend it to someone? (0=no, 1=yes)
Would I watch it again, just for fun? (0=no, 1=once, 2=muiltiple times)
Quite honestly, for me the obvious answer is No, no, and No! And No!
Overall: Well 3,6 is pretty... bad. I don't like it, but if you do... Feel free to do so, thats called taste.
Tl;dr: Forgettable story with lot of flaws and filler, acceptable artworks, rather weak OST and voiceovers, and a weak character development.
I'm always open for feedback, thanks in advance!",4,Play2X,

                There’s nothing quite like it when you come off an anime and realize how much it has built itself as this vital piece of art that has since transcended its ever-present influence on other mediums. This particular show, named Cowboy Bebop, definitely lived up to the legacy it deserves of being the pinnacle of late ’90s anime that would influence a wide variety of anime leading up to the new millennium. Even with that being said, that’s not to say that Cowboy Bebop has its fair share of hiccups.
But before I get into that, it is essential to distinguish the inevitable nature that director Shinichirō
                  Watanabe constructed from the ground up to make Cowboy Bebop’s world vibrant and distinct. Since Cowboy Bebop has separate plot arcs within each episode, with some continuity within its main cast, the show has a great sense of exploratory mystery behind every story being told. You have the feeling of wanting to know these actual people and locations because of how incredibly different they all are. They each have their distinct look and atmosphere to them. As Watanabe is vastly known, he loves to mix different types of genres into one show to make them feel unique in his eyes. Usually, this could cause an anime to lose some main focus on what it wants to be, but Cowboy Bebop, thanks to its plot structure, paces these genres evenly to make us know its true identity. 
Along with mixing these genres, the sense of direction that encapsulates Cowboy Bebop as a whole transcends itself to a whole new level of creativity. The noir aspect of the show adds a lot more depth to its atmosphere, from its attention-grabbing shootout scenes to the silent moments that hook you instantaneously. There are some comedy elements to be seen in Cowboy Bebop, and the writers time it very well and give all the characters great charm to provide reliable, entertaining moments. They don’t just contain physical comedy by any stretch, but instead, the writing is very sharp and witty whether you’re watching it dubbed or subbed.
Memorable characters are in no shortage in Cowboy Bebop, at least within its main cast. Spike Spiegel, Faye Valentine, Jet Black, and Edward are the quintessential quartet to be studied if you want to replicate a great form of characters such as this. They are not just good because of their tremendous character growth, but the fantastic chemistry they all have whenever they are on-screen together. At first, they all act very indecently to each other. It isn’t until throughout several episodes that they genuinely try to care for one another, yet they still feel the slight edge to go on their own for better or worse.
Spike is often regarded as the best character, and they aren’t entirely wrong in saying so. He has an alluring presence where he isn’t just some strong individual who can handle himself in any given situation or this average person. He has the wit and personality to be both of these personalities, and you want to root for him because of his likable persona. It would be a crime not to mention the Dubbed performance by famed voice actor Stephen Blum who manages to make Spike have a lot suave with his extraordinary voice. And for that matter, almost all of the English dubbed voice actors work to make Cowboy Bebop one of the few instances where the dubbing is just as good, if not better, than the original Japanese voice acting.
Faye Valentine provides some of the funniest, sarcastic humor to Cowboy Bebop. You could easily chalk her character archetype as a way to push a female character in a predominantly male present cast to let the males have their way with her body. However, they manage to make Faye into a girl who doesn’t take any crap from anyone and has complete control over anything that she finds wrong in her mind. Then we have Edward, who is by far the most eccentric character of the show because she’s in her little world where nothing seems to make her overly pessimistic, no matter how grave a situation might be. What makes her fascinating to watch is her growth as a person while at the same time viewing her child-like charm in the same way we would have viewed Edward’s way of thinking as a child. Every time she’s on-screen, there is a good chance anything is possible in terms of comedic dialogue being thrown out,  and they are all fantastic to listen to. Lastly is Jet Black, who’s the most logically, down-to-earth character in the show, other than maybe Spike in most cases. While he may be the lesser of the three leads, there is no doubt to be made that Jet has his fair share of memorable moments that grows him into an actual three-dimensional character like the rest.
With this being said about our four main heroes, the rest of the side characters that crop up in these plot arcs are not spectacular or memorable. Even the show's main villain doesn’t leave much of an impression in being a noteworthy villain as initially anticipated. This problem could be forgiven slightly, considering they have only one episode to build them up, but that is not to say all of them are not noteworthy, with the Dr. Lobbes character being the best of the bunch. Considering that he was in one of the best episodes that weren’t the last three episodes that succeeded it.
Around the time when Cowboy Bebop first aired, anime recently had begun somewhat of a transitional period where it started to incorporate very challenging, philosophical themes into its narrative. The other two that come to mind are Neon Genesis Evangelion and Serial Experiments Lain. That’s not to say anime did not have anything like this before, but Cowboy Bebop and the other shows I mentioned pushed it off the stream of consciousness into the anime community. With that said, Cowboy Bebop seems to be the one that is the most subtle way of detailing its philosophical themes involving existential concepts. This approach to integrating these themes is both a service and a disservice to the show’s credit.
Although it is very admirable for Bebop to showcase its themes in a non-preachy scenario or get muddled into strange concepts that contradict each other, it subtly limits it from doing anything with most of the narrative plot arcs. You can basically watch Cowboy Bebop and have all of them fly over your head, and you would still have the same experience, but once you do notice them, there’s not a lot of meat for our brains to digest or digest comprehend. The show's finale has a significant implication of putting them all together. Still, in the long run, they don’t add up to anything other than trying to throw out whatever philosophical theme that might seem the most probable in these given situations.
While that aspect wasn’t necessarily one of the show’s best highlights, the plot that carries the main narrative is relatively serviceable and brings up one of the most poignant finales I’ve ever seen in anime. When you feel the growth that all of these characters go through, you never want these characters to go away from one another because of how amazing they play off one another. Once I saw them go their separate ways for a moment, without spoiling any of the necessary details, I almost felt upset that they were even inclined to do so in the first place. Because of the amount of care given to make the personalities of these characters genuine and delightful, the contemplative nature near the finale feels very sincere. If that is writing that could not be considered significant by that fact alone, I don’t know what is.
I’ve always believed that Yoko Kanno is one of the best composers to be working in anime to this day, and Cowboy Bebop reigns as the best-coordinated orchestration that she ever did. The opening itself garners some needed praise not only for its recognizable melodies and instrumentation but for how it captures the feel and tone of Cowboy Bebop as a whole. What fits Yoko’s style of instrumentation and Watanabe’s creative vision is how they both have the same way of mixing different types of music and genres that make them feel very on-point with the direction of the art style and the score that goes with it. Yoko’s fantastic blend of jazz, traditional orchestration, guitar rock, and occasional electronics create the ultimate soundtrack that would be worthy of being listened to without the need for the show’s visuals to accompany it.
Does Cowboy Bebop deserve the number of perfect accolades that it has gotten for the past decade or so? In most aspects, it certainly does. There is simply nothing out there that is quite like it in terms of authentic style and flair that is on-screen back then and now. It manages to perfectly pace the witty humor from the deep drama that engulfs each character and the confrontations they have to face, one way or the other. If anything, the characters are enough to warrant a watch of their unique chemistry, and the plot can be well-serviceable for anyone willing to experience it. It’s a show that literally goes off with a bang and soars ever so gently off into the blissful reaches of the heavens. This space cowboy can prove himself worthy of being called such a title in great character stories such as this.

                ""Cowboy Bebop"" reeks. It really does. It reeks of originality, it reeks of attitude, but most of all, it reeks of perfection.
I'm not gonna bother writing about how cool the main protagonist Spike Spiegel is, or how colourful the rest of the cast are - those are established facts and have been discussed to death already, so I'm gonna write about what makes ""Cowboy Bebop"" different instead. Almost everything about it is unusual. It's a clash of a huge number of often contradicting styles that, on paper, looks like disasters waiting to happen. However, the reality is that ""Cowboy Bebop"" takes everything in its stride
                  and pulls off the stunt with flying colours. It catches the attention straight away with its strikingly retro opening sequence reminiscent of a typical jazzy 70/80's TV series. The feel of the anime itself is a seamless marriage of anime sci-fi and American westerns, backed up by some slick jazz/blues (as well as other African-American influenced) sound track. Even discounting these obvious western influences, it's still very un-anime like in a lot of respects - the art style goes for what I would call stylish realism, it's very slightly comically oriented, with no giant eyed cuteness or super distortions in sight. The humour it uses is also mostly toned down, subtle, western humour as opposed to the in your face, over the top slap stick found in most other anime. And yet, at other times, its anime roots shine through brightly - for example the character design of Vicious, with his katana and grey/white hair, is about as anime as you can get (well, maybe he could do with longer hair, like Sephiroth's from Final Fantasy VII).
Even in its content, ""Cowboy Bebop"" breaks new ground. It doesn't go for a long continuous plot, but instead opts for the episodic format, but with one flagship storyline spanning 5 episodes that pops in during various parts of the series. This doesn't sound special by itself, but what is remarkable is the sheer diversity found in the episodes. It proclaims itself to be a work that ""becomes a new genre in itself"", which might sound arrogant to the point of delusional. But this bold, swaggering claim actually has a ring of truth to it. ""Cowboy Bebop"" is like a huge number of genres combined, and yet doesn't fully fit into any particular one simply because it's composed of so many. Like one of those annoying people that you used to know from school who is good at everything, whatever genre ""Cowboy Bebop"" touches turns to gold. The comedy is hilarious, the action is edge of the seat stuff, and the horror themed episodes do manage to create a kind of unsettling atmosphere of anticipation and suspense. I think almost everyone will find something to their taste. Moreover, since I haven't anything like this done before, and anything that comes after that dares to attempt anything that's even remotely similar will be seen as copying (for example, even though ""Samurai Champloo"", produced by the same person, is an undoubted success, it had no where near the impact of ""Cowboy Bebop""), ""Cowboy Bebop"" has effectively cemented itself as a unique experience in a class of its own. 
Quite a few of the episodes in ""Cowboy Bebop"" reveals some of the characters' backgrounds, but they don't reveal everything. For the most part, only subtle hints are given, and you're left to join up the sparsely distributed dots using your own imagination. Usually I hate this kind of thing, but you know what? In the special case of ""Cowboy Bebop"", it somehow WORKS. In this case, less is more, the show's incomplete state feels just right, and the tantalising bits of clues and short flashbacks piece together into a enigmatic, fragmental past that adds to rather than detract from the flavour of the anime. There is no better example of this than during the flagship storyline where we catch a glimpse of Spike's mysterious past. In fact these episodes deserves special mention - they are clearly meant to be the diamonds amongst the gems. In crafting these episodes, the creators obviously asked themselves the question: the short stories' collective strength lies their variety, so what can we do with this central attraction to make it stand out? The answer was obvious: it was to make it into something that's the very definition of awesomeness. And boy did they achieve it. The general gist of this story is Spike settling scores with Vicious, an old enemy from his little known past. It's a classic set up that's been used many, many times before, and on the face of it, ""Cowboy Bebop"" doesn't really bring anything new to the table. But saying this segment of ""Cowboy Bebop"" is just another one of those show down between nemesis stories is like saying J. S. Bach is just another Baroque composer. Bach was not known as an innovator, and distinguished himself as the greatest composer of his time simply by being so much better than everyone else. In the same way, ""Cowboy Bebop"" took a much used idea and, despite not doing anything that's different, produced something that's on a completely different plane to everything else. Everything about ""Cowboy Bebop"" is already smooth and polished, but in those episodes the production somehow manages to climb up yet another level, and every single fiber of it is executed to perfection.
That Spike vs Vicious segment of ""Cowboy Bebop"" is so good in fact, that viewers often mistake it as the only story ""Cowboy Bebop"" is trying to tell, and thus the other episodes naturally gets mistaken as fillers, and this is one of the most common criticisms levelled at ""Cowboy Bebop"" - it's composed almost entirely of fillers. But I think this is missing the whole point of the series. Just like a serious show should not be faulted for not being funny, ""Cowboy Bebop"" should not be faulted for being episodic, but should be judged based on what it's trying to achieve. What it is trying to achieve is variety, and thus purposefully avoided the continuous story format. Those ""fillers"" are essential building blocks towards achieving this aim, and so shouldn't really be regarded as fillers at all. Real fillers would be like in ""Full Moon wo Sagashite"", where they actually got a continuous story to tell, but instead of telling it chose to go faffing around on mostly unrelated mini adventures that nearly put me to sleep. The key question is does ""Cowboy Bebop"" deliver what it's trying to deliver, and there is no doubt in my mind that is does.
It's generally acknowledged that ""Cowboy Bebop"" is not a deep anime, so the fact that shows up at the top of so many critics' list arguably makes it the biggest triumph for a style over substance anime. The show's ending theme is called ""The Real Folk's Blues"" (ironically, it's actually a rock song) - rather appropriately, I thought, because this series frequently give rise to some of the most contemplative, melancholy moments despite not being terribly deep. These kind of moments often left me with a feeling of immense fulfilment as the end credits starts to roll. Perhaps it's this engimatic quality that lends it that special aura. It may not be my personal favourite, but unlike, say, ""Elfen Lied"", I can certainly see why it deserves to be labelled as the greatest ever - I, for one, am not about to argue against it.",9,kekekeKaj,

                Story, Character, and Enjoyment: 10/10 Drama Llama? 
Cowboy Bebop is probably the most amazing anime I have had the privilege of watching. Even now, seven years after watching it for the first time I am having difficulty putting it into words. What is so unique about it is how the episodes don't link together, but instead mainly focus on a character or two. Director Shinichiro Watanabe did such an amazing job flushing out the characters whether the current episode shows them living their day-by-day life in the present, or delving into a certain characters unique past it really makes the Cowboy Bebop universe seem tangible.
                  Unfortunately this is also Cowboy Bebop's downfall. Not because it's bad, but because so many people pass this by thinking it has no story. To those that think this is the case I encourage you to go back, and watch the whole thing. Not only does this anime give you the most amazing character development it manages to weave in a story along the way right under your nose. Until the last two episodes hit, then you will understand what it was all about. When it was all said and done for me my first time through, and the series came to an end, I felt like I had just witnessed my best friend get run over by a bus. Most people probably think that sounds terrible, but it takes something truly great to yank that much emotion out of you.
Animation: 10/10 Keepin' it real.
CB's animation is truly something to behold. It matches very well with the character development in making the whole series seem tangible. Character proportions are well regulated, and maintained through the whole thing. Which is very important to me in an anime. It does a much better job then huge block buster animes being released now, e.g. Naruto/Bleach.
When you speak about animation of CB you definitely have to speak of the action sequences. The gunfights, and hand-to-hand combat are superb. Spike constantly gets injured also making it seem much more realistic, and interesting. The best part though about them is there is hardly any bullshit talking interrupting   the action. I don't know about you, but I hate when two characters stop in the middle of a fight to drink some tea, and have a ten minute conversation, emo flash-back included. I could go on and on, but then what would be the point of you watching it.
Sound: 10/10 The hills are alive...
Tank! is absolutely the only anime music I will ever have included in my play-list.  Which says a lot, because normally when I start an episode of something fresh off the torrents I pretty much skip past the opening theme. That being said, CB is deeply rooted in Jazz music, but it all sounds beautiful when played side by side with the anime. I've never been much a musician, but I do know what I enjoy, and what I don't enjoy. It all sounds excellent, and I'm not a big jazz fan at all.   Not to mention Yoko Kanno mentioned to slap some Pink Floyd into episode 20, Perriot le Fou. Don't believe me? Go pop in Dark Side of the Moon, and skip to track 2.
Overall Cowboy Bebop is one big tribute to many cultures. Whether it be John Woo style gun fights, the Indian sitting in his tee-pee with his playstation, 1337 haxxors, or the Japanese's immense fear of dieing. There is a lot that Cowboy Bebop parodies while still managing to keep itself original. I'm tired of all the dime-a-dozen anime characters. E.g. the clumsy yet dormant super powerful main character, or the silent bad ass who's family died, and is in all reality an emo kid screaming out for attention. I've seen both these character types a hundred times over. This is why I idolize Cowboy Bebop, and truly believe that it is the best anime of all time.",10,jupiterjazz,

                To start with, I want to point out that I don't understand the glory this anime gets. I watched it because of the ""No way!! You didn't watch Cowboy Bebop?!"". This can surely ruin one's experience with a show. So please, when recommending an anime, don't hype over it so much, that raises the expectation of the watcher and he might get into this mentality where he is just trying to point out anything he dislikes. At least this is what's happening here with me.
While I watch this anime, I feel like ""And?"". Where is the story going? Most episodes feel like they aren't contributing
                  to anything. The characters are very well introduced, we get a good background of their life. Yes, I didn't complete watching it, but I believe that if the plot doesn't seem to be going anywhere after watching half the anime's episodes, then it's not worth my time. It felt like I'm watching fillers.
It's one of those three:
1. It's very slow paced and everything becomes clear in the last episode/s.
2. It has an open ending.
3. Both 1 and 2, very slow paced and has an open ending.
I always had this thought just before starting the next episode ""Maybe we'll get to understand something in this episode"". Some people said ""Maybe you're not a fan of the classics."", I still don't know what ""the classics"" mean, and I doubt that will change my opinion..
DISCLAIMER: This isn't a professional review. It's MY review.",3,MapzOr,
1,"
                I was scared to touch this anime. Despite the reviews, despite my friend's sage advice, despite everything, I resisted for months. I didn't want to dive into something that showed only on Adult Swim at 2 in the morning on weekdays. It didn't seem like the kind of show I wanted to watch. I want to see the latest and greatest, the anime that grab the headlines, that are here and now, that are modern and are visually appealing. Cowboy Bebop didn't seem to me like it fit into any category I ever liked either. Western styled mixed with space drama? How can that even
                  mix? Old style animation from the late 90s? Kinda makes me think of Hey Arnold and those other shows. It just didn't seem to fit the mood I currently reside in. And then I picked up the first episode. And I am a changed man. 
First, some background: it's a simple enough story. Spike and Jet, two oddities that somehow coexist inside the same spaceship, are partnered together in the pursuit of so-called bounties (fitting the western theme), and thus are called bounty hunters. Along the way in the beginning, they pick up some more companions to put the word ""rag-tag"" to shame: Faye Valentine, a debt-ridden woman who has forgotten her past, Ed (Edward), the pre-teen genius girl with computers, and Ein, the genetically enhanced and intelligent Corgi. The five travel the stars, attempting to gain bounties, but the results are....somewhat mixed.
Story: 9/10
I was skeptical. I truly was. I never liked western films, and I never cared for the themes and such of the Ol' Wild West. But the meld of science fiction with modern amenities really hit home. I could actually relate to the story, and oh what a story it was. Besides being such a motley bunch, they often were never agreeable and seemed to barely hold the peace in Jet's ship Bebop. But something about the way the story was told, how each character's mysterious past seemed to interfere with the present. Half of the series wasn't really fighting for bounties, but trying to bury or avoid their individual past without notifying or effecting the other persons aboard the ship, to no avail. It was interesting, then, when the past comes back to haunt you: nothing is as it seems on the surface, and when the past scratches at its coffin, you better be there with a nail or sig-sauer. 
Art: 10/10
I must say, at first it was hard to....understand and perceive the old-style animation. This made me want to turn it off and watch the anime of today. But you got used to it real quick. And I must say, for something almost two decades old, it's gorgeous. The lighting, the style, the drawings, the shades, the colors, the environment...It was hard not to notice the variety of places the art alluded to, and of course the western touch with the deserts and saloons and gunfights and such. I loved every bit of it, and remember, I hate the west. The spaceships juxtaposed next to the average car and the old-fashioned lighters lighting old-fashioned cigarettes created this interesting mood and ambiance, one I hadn't felt....ever. It was surreal.
Sound: 9.5/10
Alright, before you blast me with why it isn't perfect, it wasn't. But it was damn near perfect. Jazz? Blues? Fast-paced music? Are those ENGLISH lyrics? Yes they all are here, for you, the watcher, to enjoy. Every major scene had a fast-paced song, and many a time it was in English. The producers and editors and such probably drew much of their inspiration from the American West, and it showed well in the sound. The OP was fast-paced and well executed, and the ED was nostalgic sounding and epic. But I didn't get too focused on the petty ending and beginning; it was the background music I'm talking about. Beautiful, beautiful salute to the American west and native American music. I couldn't get enough, especially when the main characters are so motley, the odd choice of music just made the mood that much better. And why stop there? The voice actors should be praised, no given medals, their acting was so good. It wasn't even the way each character spoke, but when each character decided to show his or her true nature to the viewer before quickly covering it up; beautiful just beautiful. 
Character: 10/10
Oh how I would rate this higher if I could. I've never had such deep characters before, such amazingly portrayed people. Pretend each character is a book: Spike would be a carefree one, its leather new, its polish gleaming. Jet would be gruff and rough on the edges, worn from time. Faye's would be delicate, with an evil-looking cover that betrays evil, and so on. But as you delve deeper in the story and therefore each character's secret past, the books become much different: Spike's becomes worn and rough, like Jet's, frayed on the outside, with a hole punched straight through the middle. Jet's would be more worn, yet have a soft spot in the middle. Faye's would have a huge question mark from chapter 1 to somewhere around the middle, then soften into a golden hue. Seems stupid, but I ain't spoiling anything. But honestly, each of these characters deserves his or her own biography; each story, so different from each other, yet they all come back to haunt them in the present. And as each character deals with their ghosts, they must make a tough decision: to let the ghost keep haunting them, or to finally put it all to rest? If you don't like extended analogies, then go watch Cowboy Bebop and skip my review. Time's a wastin'. 
When I think of Cowboy Bebop, I don't think of old, garish, rubbish pictures of grainy animation and slipshod storylines made to fit the mass audience it tries and fails to appeal to. What I see now is a masterpiece that will last the ages - and I should have known better if an anime gets a English adaptation and is shown in America for over a decade it should be pretty freaking good. And I finally digress; if I am not able to convince you to watch the show by now, I have failed as a reviewer because, if anything, this was the best show I've ever watched. I can't say that for anything else, because I'm one of those people that says everything is his favorite show. But this easily trumps all that. See you later, Space Cowboy.",10,Ibelucas,
1,"
                Let be the one that forces down the hammer of judgment on this Anime, because honestly it is one of the Anime (and i rarely do this) that i really do not advise you to watch, if you are the one the feels attached to the characters throughout the story-line (i hope you get me on that one).
First of all i should say that in the animation, sound fields the Anime did pretty well considering the date in which the Anime was Aired. However i should say that the story-line failed miserably. It is rare for a 26 episodes Anime, to not have develop an
                  escalating intensity of events as the story goes on, yet Cowboy Bebop demonstrated the utmost failure a writer could achieve. At the beginning of the story till before the last two episodes the story would be running in a direction(really boring direction), however, and i do not know why, in the last two it goes in a totally different direction totally irrelevant to what you have seen in the first 24 episodes. The Characters also fail, in result of the writer unable to decide what he wants to show out of them. Again i really do not know why they expect people to applaud to the ending. They wanted to make the ending look epic, i seriously thought that in the end it will be all like a dream a Character is having, i was shocked when it ended.",5,KyokuShin,

                Overview:
Today I will look at what is probably the most universally well received anime by non-otaku and casual viewers. It is well known that ""film snobs"" don't have the same taste as average film goers. A film snob will say Citizen Kane or Tokyo Story is the best movie of all time whereas an average viewer will generally choose something like The Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption. With anime it is the same way. If Legend of the Galactic Heroes is the Citizen Kane of anime revered by all the elitist snobs, and all those people making a pathetic attempt to ""prove"" that they are
                  intellectuals, than Cowboy Bebop is The Godfather of anime. It is THE anime of the common man.
Story: 8/10
Cowboy Bebop is largely episodic and many episodes stand alone, but it does have an overall plot that moves forward. The story takes place in a future where warp gates have made rapid travel between the planets easy and most of the solar system has been terraformed and colonized. However, a hypergate above Earth exploded and badly damaged the moon. This caused large chunks of moon to bombard Earth and devastate much of the human population, so few humans remain on our original home world. Our main protagonist is a bounty hunter named Spike Spiegel (extremely Jewish last name) who is visually modeled on the body of Lupin the 3rd with Bob Dylan's hair and face. You know, because Shinichi Watanabe is an insane person. Spike's partner is an ex-cop and jazz enthusiast named Jet Black, who is a white man obviously voiced by a black man. You know...because Watanabe is an insane person. On their many adventures they meet a Taiwanese scam artist who claims to be a Gypsy, a genetically modified Welsh Corgi, and an androgenous, genius computer hacker. The crew of the Bebop will take on any job no matter how dangerous, but something always seems to go wrong and they never get paid very much for all their efforts. We also find out that Spike once worked for a major crime syndicate and has a tragic past love with a woman named Julia and unfinished business with a vicious mobster simply named...Vicious.
Characters: 10/10
Cowboy Bebop has an absolutely amazing cast of characters. Spike is one of the most beloved protagonists in all of anime. He is a master bounty hunter and the baddest Jew in space! Jet's humor is a bit more dry than other characters like Edward, but now that I'm older I find myself liking Jet quite a bit. Faye is a voluptuous femme fatale that is quite amusing throughout the series with her schemes and antics, and Ed is...just Ed. With the red hair, gender ambiguity, obvious Asperger's, and being the world's greatest computer hacker and Chess Player, Ed shares a surprising number of traits with Lisbeth Salender of the Millenium Trilogy. Maybe Ed gave birth to Lisbeth after an affair with the short tempered and perpetually snarky Hiei from Yu Yu Hakusho? That would pretty much explain Lisbeth to a T. Anyways, the last character is the deliciously over the top villain simply known as Vicious. He wears a trench coat over a black military uniform, fights with a katana against opponents with guns, and always has an evil raven perched on his shoulder. What a fucking badass! When Vicious isn't carving motherfuckers up with his katana, he is smiling psychotically and scheming some devious master plan to screw yet another person over. Gotta love Vicious.
Sound: 10/10
This is by far the best Jazz soundtrack in all of anime, and perhaps the best soundtrack period. I personally like the Rurouni Kenshin/Samurai X soundtrack, but Cowboy Bebop is easily my #2. Even if you think you don't like Jazz, you will love this soundtrack. It's virtually impossible not to.
Art: 8/10
The art is somewhat dated since this show was made in the 1990s, but still holds up pretty well. It is animated a LOT less lazily than DBZ, Yu Yu Hakusho, Sailor Moon, and most other 90s anime. The character designs are interestingly enough largely based on Lupin the 3rd with Spike being given Lupin's lanky body, Jet has Jigen's beard, and Vicious has Goemon's hair and face. This was a fun and clever homage by the animators to a 1970s classic.
Enjoyment: 10/10
I rated it a 10 because it won't let me pull a Spinal Tap and give it that extra little oomph up to 11! This series has plane dogfights, epic shootout scenes, fist fights, swordplay, and any kind of action you can think of. The series also homages many classic movies and genres depending on what planet the crew visits. Hell, there is even a blaxploitation film tribute episode!
Overall: 10/10
Cowboy Bebop is not my personal #1 anime of all time, but it is definitely in my top 10. Even though there are series that are closer to my heart on a personal level, Bebop is probably the most flawless anime I have ever seen. There is literally nothing to hate about this series. The art, storytelling, characters, music, and direction are all so well done that I can't imagine anyone saying that this sucks! I am emotionally attached to a few series above Bebop, but I recognize that those series have some flaws and see why others might mock and ridicule them. To use a baseball analogy, Cowboy Bebop doesn't quite swing for the fences in that same way where it will either be a grand slam or a strike out. Bebop is that perfect line drive that may not knock it out of the park for you, but it will definitely connect and be a respectable hit! If you are new to anime or if you are under the age of 20 and have simply never seen this slightly older series, you should check it out!",10,literaturenerd,

                Title: Cowboy Bebop
Manga, Anime: Cowboy Bebop has two manga incarnations to its name.  The first, with the same title as the show, is a manga adaptation of the anime, with story by Hajime Yamate and art by Yutaka Nanten, and ran in Kadokawa Shoten's Asuka Fantasy DX magazine from April 1998 to April 2000.  The second, titled Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star, is a retelling of the anime, done by Cain Kuga, and also ran in Asuka Fantasy DX during 1997.  Both have been licensed Stateside by Tokyopop, and the release date for the third and second and final volumes for both were
                  August 20th, 2002, and June 10th, 2003.
The anime itself ran for twenty-six episodes, though it originally had a disrupted run on TV Tokyo from April 3rd to June 19th, 1998, before airing in full on a disrupted broadcast schedule on the satellite network WOWOW from October 23rd, 1998 to April 23rd, 1999.  It was produced by Sunrise (famous for their work on Inuyasha and the Gundam series), and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe (famous for his work on Macross Plus and Samurai Champloo).  It was licensed Stateside by Bandai Entertainment, and the box set of the Remix episodes (which was also the version I watched) was released on February 5th of this year (2008).  There is a movie that was released not long after the series ended, which I will cover later in the review.
Story: It's the year 2071 AD, and mankind has colonized the entire solar system.  Spike Spiegel is a Cowboy (this era's term for bounty hunters) who works with Jet Black to track down bounties and struggle to live off of them.  Along the way, they pick up a few extra people and their pasts are bought to light.
Cowboy Bebop is, for the most part, a bounty of the week episode, with some minor continuing threads.  All in all, it's done pretty well, with bounties delving into the pasts of characters, and being just interesting in general.  The characters are an interesting bunch of people, with Ed taking the cake as crack in human form.  :P  
Some will complain that the plot in the last two episodes comes out of nowhere, but they're a bit inaccurate there; the threads have been building up in episodes here and there throughout the show, though they are admittedly a bit scattered.
Art: The show's a bit dated, obviously.  But, compared to other shows that were airing around that time (Ruroni Kenshin, Beserk), the animation is pretty good.  The designs for characters are very well done, and the designs for the ships and all the backgrounds in particular are amazingly detailed.
Music: Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts did the work for this soundtrack, and it's absolutely amazing.  There's so much variety in all the variations on jazz and blues that they do for this, and it's amazingly catchy.  This was one of the first soundtracks I actively noticed in a show and tried to find.  
They also did work on the OP, &quot;Tank!&quot; (which Baccano! takes a cue from) and ED, &quot;The Real Folk Blues&quot;, both of which are instantly memorable and fit the series quite well.
Length: I liked sixteen out of the twenty-six total episodes, and the series probably would've done well to keep those episodes in the long run and cut the rest.  Still, all in all, that's a pretty good percentage.
Seiyuu: Megumi Hayashibara (famous for her roles as Rei Ayanami in Evangelion and Atsuko Chiba and Paprika in Paprika) plays Faye Valentine in this, and Jouji Nakata appears in a minor role.  I admire Ed's seiyuu for being able to capture the sheer crazy of her character.  All in all, a pretty good job.
Voice Actors: Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime I watched, back when it was regularly airing on Adult Swim.  When I went back to watch it, I found that, all things considered, the voice actors did a pretty good job with their roles.  The voices weren't quite the same, but, all in all, still fit the characters pretty well.  One of the better dubs I've seen out there.
Dub: Looking back on the dub, it was one of the better dubs I saw back when I was first getting into anime.  A few lines of dialogue were altered in the English version, and some minor edits were made so that it was able to air on TV, but compared to DiC's butchering of Sailor Moon, it was a pretty good job.  If only they could've all been this good.
Overall: A well-done show, with an episodic plot that delves into it's character's past that sporadically builds to the conclusion, detailed animation, amazing music, and a pretty good dub.  
Definitely in my top ten shows; a must-watch.

                I'm not one to jump on the hype train. I try to not get high hopes for anything, because usually you are going to be let down. I've heard the praise for this show so many times over the years. Google ""Top Ten Anime Series"" and almost every list will have Bebop in it, usually at #1. So I went in hesitantly, and I've gotta tell you...
Cowboy Bebop is a goddamn masterpiece.
Each episode is usually standalone. That right there tends to steer a lot of would-be viewers away from this series. Even I was a bit hesitant to plunge into a show with an episodic
                  structure. But I'll tell you, this show really pulls it off. There are a few episodes that connect together, but for the most part, it's a standalone affair.
The series follows the bounty hunting crew of the good ship Bebop in the year 2071. It depicts their daily lives as bounty hunters, as well as giving us insight into their pasts. Most episodes or ""sessions"" as they are called, tend to focus on the crew attempting to secure a bounty. This might sound a tad bit repetitive, but I swear it's not. The sheer unpredictability and creativity that is put into each session assures the audience that things will never get boring.
The strength of the show really isn't in its plot, though. It's the characters that drive the series forward. They are all incredibly well developed, which is an amazing feat due to the episodic nature of the show. Each of the four principle characters are completely different, and they all feel real and authentic. 
Them all being squeezed into one ship creates a brilliant stew of character interaction. Their ideals and viewpoints clash on the regular, which creates some interesting scenes. They also bond over time, even though some of the characters try their best to hide it. 
Their pasts are also heavily explored, as one of the recurring themes throughout the show is that your past will always catch up with you. This applies more to the central character, Spike Spiegel, more than the rest however. Each member of the main cast gets a few episodes specifically focusing on them, adopting a flashback format. These are generally the best episodes of the show, in my opinion.
I fell in love with these characters, and it was heartbreaking to see them go through so many ordeals. Spike, Jet, Faye, and Ed won't leave your mind for a long time after you finish the show.
The art and animation are incredibly good for its time. There are some series now that fail to reach Bebop's level of artistic beauty and fluid animation. For example, Trigun, which came out around the same time, is nothing compared to Sunrise's work on Bebop. The art isn't too flashy, but it perfectly creates a realistic space western feel. You feel like this world has been lived in, and things aren't always pretty. The character designs in particular are impressive, as each member of the cast has a different and recognizable look. 
The animation is flawless. Absolutely flawless. This is expertly conveyed in the action scenes, which have a naturalistic and fluid feel to them that is rarely achieved in anime. The only flaw on the art and animation fronts is the computer generated graphics that are used several times during the show. They look out of place and don't really meld well with the environments, but hey, the show came out in 1998! I think I can cut it some slack. Still worth mentioning though.
The soundtrack is where this show excels at a level I don't think I've ever heard before. The mix of jazz and blues, with a little bit of classic rock thrown in brings the show to life. It fits the mood of the show perfectly, even though it might sound odd for a science fiction show. It works, though, I swear it. As a testament to its greatness, I'm listening to the soundtrack right now, as I write this review. Props to Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts, for real. I mean, ""Space Lion"" is one of the greatest tracks I've ever heard.
The English dubbing of this show is in a class of its own. It fits the show perfectly, with each cast member giving it their all. I don't know how good the Japanese audio track is, but it's going to be hard to beat this. It's fucking unbelievable. I mean, Steve Blum kills it.
This show is considered a classic today. I had heard all the praise. Not once did I buy it. I went into this show thinking that it probably wasn't going to live up to its praise. I was wrong. Dead wrong. 
The sophistication of it's themes and characters are unrivaled in anime. The beautiful art and stunning animation. The wonderful soundtrack. The great ending. Oh yes, the ending. It's a stunning conclusion that managed to wow me and break my heart at the same time. This is animation at its finest.

                ""And the work which has become a genre unto itself shall be called: Cowboy Bebop"" 
^ This sentence was showed several times during the episodes and it is already giving away about the uniqueness Cowboy Bebop carries. There are many unique anime in our anime world, but most of them fail to execute it well. However, fortunately that is not the case with Cowboy Bebop. It is a truly classic anime with incredibly awesome soundtrack and brilliant character development.
Cowboy Bebop centers around a group of bounty hunters in a futuristic, space-western setting. The year is 2071 and the place is our Solar System, where various
                  planets and moons have been terraformed for human settlement. Bebop is a spaceship where two bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black are travelling around the space and hunting down their preys to earn money. Along the way their duo (2) becomes a quintet (5) when the engineered dog Ein, beautiful yet very complicated women Faye Valentine, and computer genius teenage girl Edward (yes a girl) joins their group, or I should say forced themselves in.
This newly formed bounty hunter group is ridiculously unlucky since the day their duo became a quintet. However, this is exactly what brings the comedy. Their unlucky hunt probably is due to the lack of teamwork and recognition of each other skills. Even though they are all highly skilled in certain areas, they all usually go alone on the job which is what makes the series even more entertaining.
Yes, the plot is not the main engine of Cowboy Bebop series. Every episode is a new story and rarely has any relevance to the past episodes. Sometimes they are dramatic, sometimes comedic and sometimes very serious. When the episode starts, you simply have no clue what theme and mood this time it will be and will they capture their prey or not, or maybe it will be one of those rare episodes when they follow the main story of Cowboy Bebop? In any case, all episodes are very enjoyable and unpredictable.
Since the plot is not the main engine, then what exactly makes Cowboy Bebop series so amazing that it is usually listed in most anime top lists? Well that probably is characters and OST. Every one of the main character's have some really harsh past that they do not want to share with anyone at all. It is something they treasure a lot. All of this does not stop them from some really amusing interaction.
As I mentioned already, they have some really harsh pasts. This ""past"" thing is what gives a lot of room for the character development. Their past is not revealed in one short episode and what is most important - the way their past is revealed. Usually past is revealed by jumping into flashbacks, however that is not the case with Cowbow Bebop. To see how it is done, you will have to watch it yourself, but I can reassure you that their growth as individual and as a team member is definitely executed extremely well and in entertaining way.
Music is the other major factor why this series is so brilliant. Whole soundtrack is simply superb. This whole jazz music is fitting the story perfectly. I have never seen another anime that could go so perfectly in sync with its soundtrack. The last two episodes is kinda a showdown of the beauty that jazz can actually offer in combination with great story.
What is really surprising that animation is rather good considering in what year Cowboy Bebop aired. Usually I am very picky on the old anime because I cannot withstand crappy animation and just because of this I avoided Cowboy Bebop too. Well now I can certainly say that either the series were so entertaining that I did not notice animation flaws or the animation was just simply good enough considering it was released in 1998.
Overall, Cowboy Bebop is in the anime top tier list definitely for a reason. With its great amusing characters, beautiful and very fitting jazz music it also gives many short yet brilliant stories. I am not afraid to use this word to describe Cowboy Bebop at all - MASTERPIECE.
P.S. I must praise the voice actors who dubbed it amazingly well. I do not know how was the Japanese dubs, but English were great.",10,Ovyda,

                First of all, let it be known that Cowboy Bebop is an episodic anime. This changes the whole scope of the piece, as it's goal is completely different from those of more traditional ways of storytelling. And so, it shall be interpreted and criticized as such. 
To put it briefly, if you heard of Cowboy Bebop as a classic, a masterpiece, and as such you are expecting a coherent plot with well-written characters - you're in for a wave of disappointment. 
As with most stories told in an episodic fashion, depth and complexity are often compromised, as the main scope of the show is to
                  provide individual episodes with their own complete stories. But, when done right, these separate encounters can really add to the whole, creating a strong story and interesting characters, while still delivering short stories with their own charm. This is NOT true for Cowboy Bebop. 
A main, overarching plot is almost entirely missing. What we do have are maybe 4 episodes worth, all of them being poorly written and shallow - REALLY shallow. It's difficult to truly criticize it without giving out spoilers, but it's just bad. A villain that we don't understand, much less care about, paper thin in every single possible way, made to look ""edgy and badass"". Kids will love it. Shallow foreshadowing of events of the past, that turn out to be the most generic and uninteresting of stories. Main characters that are more like stylish mannequins rather than actual human beings. All tied to a bunch of inconsistencies and forced storytelling. The ""laid-back"" atmosphere is done the wrong way, often ignoring and ridicularizing certain plot points, and then later on bringing them back to become relevant plot points that drive the story. A good example is the fact that their ship is constantly getting shot, over and over, and nothing happens. Later on, they trade a few shots with a little group of thugs and ""Oh my god, look at the ship, it's all destroyed! Now I need to get it fix and turn this into the driving point of this entire episode"". That's just a random example really, what I'm trying to say is that these things happen all the time. It's fine when it's supposed to drive other laid-back episodes, but when this goes into the main plot-line, it's a huge problem. The show tries really hard to make it's characters look ""cool"", like a 14 year old would try to describe what a ""badass"" character would be. Spike himself can be described in 3 sentances: ""smokes cigarettes"", ""is troublesome"" and ""wears big shoes"". There's literally nothing else that adds to the character, no more depth than that. Oh, wait, I almost forgot! He has fluffy hair. The anime won't go on for 2 minutes without someone having to light up a cigarette. ""Oh, there are people shooting me? Wait a sec, lemme light up my cigg"" is what Spike boils down to. He may look stylish and unique - but he's still shallow and forced. I'm not saying these are bad things or that they comprimise the show - just that it's a ridiculously failed attempt to give depth to shallow characters - resorting to forced style. And this is why Bebop is a failure when judged as a whole - it's incoherent, cheap, and, above all, shallow. Cigarettes and jazz won't fix a bad show.
Besides all that, we obviously need to talk about the main thing when it comes to episodic storytelling - the short stories themselves. This is most likely what will determine if you like the show or not, given that the main thing these shows try to acomplish is delivering meaningful episodes that can be watched and enjoyed individually. This is why the previous paragraph doesn't excuse Bebop from being good - it could have been good as a whole, but it doesn't really need to. It's an episodic anime, so we shall judge the short stories as well, as they can and should be the selling point here. This is where it may get a bit subjective - even though I believe in objectivity when reviewing things, when we are talking about humor and attachment, it can get a bit complicated. So, instead, I'll just give my personal opinion - it's atrocious. The comedy wasn't funny, the exagerated facial expressions all the time aren't really my thing. The short stories were meaningless, generic and formulaic. It's Stardust Crusaders S1 levels of bad (don't mind me, I love JoJo regardless). There wasn't a single positive thing that I can say about them, I just didn't enjoy them at all. Actually, I did like one of them - Cowboy Funk. But the rest, argh. My philosophy is that a bad piece doesn't come from the negatives - it comes from the lack of positives. And, really, I just don't see why anyone would ever like these short stories. 
With that being said, I still didn't give Bebop a 1, did I? Look, it's a 4. There are two reasons for that. First, the anime is unique and atmospheric. Second, the last three episodes were really well executed (well executed, still poorly written, mind you). If the last three episodes weren't as good as they were, in fact, I'd be glad to give Bebop a 2. Everything was handled in a mature way, the ending is just the way I love endings, there's some emotional build up and resolution, and it's all stylish - really stylish. Don't get me wrong though - those episodes are a resolution on top of bad writing from 23 other episodes, and have to carry the weight of shallowness (how paradoxically poetic, wow!) of all it's characters. In other words, it doesn't fix the show in any way, but gives me the feeling it could have been great had the show been given more depth. Also, all the style in the world won't cover it's negatives and lack of positives. But hey, it did get the show from a 2 to a 4. 
I kinda get why someone would like Bebop. If you like the short stories, maybe cause you have a fetish for space cowboys, maybe cause you find it hilarious somehow, maybe cause style is higher in your priority list. Whatever the reason is, if you like the short stories, I can see someone liking the whole. I mean, as I mentioned, it's an episodic series, so having enjoyable short stories is enough to make it enjoyable. That may lead to further attachment to the characters (undeserved attachment that is, cause this doesn't excuse the fact they're shallow, mind you), which may lead to a some overlooking of the show's flaws, which may lead to a biased 10/10 review on MAL. Are you wondering if you'll enjoy Bebop? Just watch a random episode, out of context, and see if you enjoy it. Cause you won't get much more than that. If you like it and look forward to rewatching that through 25 other episodes - go ahead and give Bebop a try, you'll like it. If you find it uninsteresting and lacking, you'll hate Bebop for sure. But, hey, it's a classic - you have no choice here. You have to watch it.
TL;DR: No amount of cigarettes and jazz can fix a bad show.",4,Azeew,

                I had the chance to watch Cowboy Bebop before. Why didn’t I watch it?
After watching Cowboy Bebop, it was as if I went through an otaku ritual. I believe that every otaku out there should watch Cowboy Bebop – at least once in their lives – and realize how anime should be done.
The story-telling, the dialogue, the feel, the emotions. Everything was just mixed right. Every episode was unique and almost perfect. Every episode started and ended in a way you didn’t expect. My personal favorite, was Session 20, Pierrot le Fou. That episode sent chills down my spine. I won’t tell why, just so
                  anyone who reads this review would feel obligated to watch Cowboy Bebop in its entirety. Session 23 was not bad either; I love the intellectual conversations about who God is throughout the episode.
The characters made this anime. I loved every single one of them (including the supporting characters) and their individual quirks. My favorite was Spike Spiegel, of course. I love it whenever he did jeet kune do, the martial arts system that was developed by Bruce Lee. It was just exciting to watch him fight. Jet Black was just as cool as Spike. I am fascinated at his bounty hunter skills, as well as his past. Any man with a past is automatically cool. I didn’t like Faye Valentine at first, mostly because of her voice, but after you get to know more about her (the anime will reveal her past), you’ll realize that she’s one strong woman. Finally, there’s Ed. She (It’s not a typo) is one wacky kid and surprisingly adorable.
The voice acting really contributed to the characters personalities. Spike, without Kouichi Yamadera’s voice, would never be as cool as he is with him. Jet’s past would almost seep through Unshou Ishizuka’s voice. I already said that Faye’s voice, more specifically Megumi Hayashibara’s voice irritated me in the beginning, but she really brought out Faye’s personality. Aoi Tada’s voice made Ed even cuter. I also have to note that the banter and random discourse between these four are absolutely entertaining.
Shinichiro Watanabe played a huge role in making Cowboy Bebop visually appealing. Watching the series was just so easy on the eyes – the scenes weren’t heavy or overloaded at all. The scenes went on smoothly, and each scene was lovely to look at. The colors were great, and the backgrounds were detailed enough. However, I did not like the 3D animation all too much cause I found it a bit too rough, but considering it was made in 1998, I guess it wasn’t that bad.
Yoko Kanno was another factor that made me love this anime so much. She is one musical genius, and I love her work on Cowboy Bebop. I think there were new tracks for every episode, and each one complimented the scenes beautifully. Each one was different too – Tank! And The Real Folk Blues were jazzy and bluesy, but there were pop, classic, whatever tracks throughout the series too. While Shinichiro Watanabe was telling a story through sight, Yoko Kanno was doing the same through sound.
Truth be told, I wasn’t enthusiastic in watching Cowboy Bebop in the beginning. That’s because I’m not really into sci-fi themes, but Cowboy Bebop was different. The thing I like about it the most is that it’s charisma transcends through time. In three words, it’s a classic.",8,jet2r0cks,
1,"
                I started because it's supposed to be a classic, but I was disappointed. There were certain aspects that I enjoyed, such as the music. There's a different style of music every episode, reflecting the theme and setting of whatever's going on, which is pretty unique.
The main thing that turned me off was the story-line. There are a few recurring themes, but it is mainly episodic, with maybe one arc that lasts and entire two episodes. The individual stories of each episode are generally okay and sometimes go deep into the backstory of the characters, giving the audience a better idea of who they are and
                  where they cam from. However there's just nothing to pull everything together. Each character has a few episodes to illustrate their backstories, but there's just nothing to pull it all together.
Overall, I think it's worth watching. It's a classic, and it's only 26 episodes. I just think that it was so over-hyped (being a classic and all) that I was just expecting more.",6,rogerwhite,

                If you've been a fan of anime for any length of time, chances are that you've come across a bunch of shows that people hail as nothing short of masterpieces such as Neon Genesis Evangelion. Now, whether or not those programmes are perfection is entirely up to interpretation but if there's one programme which has been lauded as as nothing short of a masterpiece ever since its creation, it's Cowboy Bebop. Such a lofty title is not without those who question it, and indeed there are people who happen to dislike Bebop for a variety of reasons. I personally don't think that Bebop is a
                  masterpiece (and I do consider it to be overrated), but I do see where the praise comes from. In fact, I do believe that Bebop deserves most (but not all) of the praise that it gets. Let's go into great lengths to find out why.
When it comes down to the actual story, it's rather disheartening to say that Bebop is lacking. The actual ""plot"" of the show is easily resolved within 4-5 episodes despite being 26 episodes long, so it might seem like there is a lot of filler. That's not really the case whatsoever, since Cowboy Bebop opts for a mostly episodic approach. With the exception of the 4-5 episodes where the plot moves forward, this is a show that you can jump into from virtually any point and wouldn't really get lost, provided you're familiar with the basic concept and the characters. In that regard, Cowboy Bebop may very well be considered analogous to something like Batman: The Animated Series in terms of both style and approach.
Unfortunately, Cowboy Bebop is prone to the same problems that episodic shows of its nature tend to have. If you don't know what I'm talking about, allow me to fill you in. While episodic programmes are easy to get into if you're a complete newcomer to a particular show, the quality of each episode tends to vary quite a bit. Some episodes are absolutely amazing while other episodes are rather tedious to get through. There's also the matter of certain episodes being a bit formulaic in approach. For example, you'd think that a crew of bounty hunters would at least catch a break every now and then but that's not the case at all. No matter what the situation, it's like the Bebop crew would always be down on their luck despite how skilled each member of the team is.
These might seem like relatively minor problems for a show that has a LOT of merits to stand on, but people often forget that this show is hailed as nothing short of a masterpiece. All it really takes is one relatively mediocre episode for someone with absolutely no prior knowledge of Cowboy Bebop to get a sour impression of this programme. So how would you remedy this? Obviously, you'd watch the episodes in chronological order, right? Uh... not exactly. The first four episodes aren't bad in the slightest, I fucking LOVE them as a matter of fact. But those first four episodes might not be the best introduction to a show lauded as much as Bebop is. If you really want my honest recommendation as to how you should view this programme, I'd say start out with Episode 5 just to get your general impression of the programme. If you like what you see, watch the first four episodes next and then keep watching in chronological order. The reason why you should watch it in that order if you're completely new to Bebop is simple: Episode 5 is a spectacular episode which contains virtually everything that this show is known for so if you don't like Episode 5, Bebop is most likely not going to be your cup of tea and if that's the case, watch Samurai Champloo instead.
With all that ranting out of the way, let's talk characters. The biggest strength that Bebop has when it comes down to its characters is the fact that they're played straight. This might not seem like such an accomplishment, but keep in mind that characters meant to be overacted were more or less the norm back in the 80s/90s so for its time, this was a rather huge deal. Another thing that Bebop's lead cast all share (for better or worse) are dark pasts that with the exception of Faye, they all try to avoid confronting. Why is this a good and a bad thing? On the one hand, a dark past that slowly gets revealed throughout the course of the programme makes for some awesome plot twists and they are given a fair amount of foreshadowing so the reveal doesn't come off as an asspull. HOWEVER... the concept of a ragtag bunch of misfits with each member having a dark past is a trope which has become rather commonplace in anime/manga over the course of recent years so chances are that some might find it rather cliché which brings me to another point.
While the leading cast of Bebop certainly does a good job of carrying the story without feeling like cardboard cut-outs a good majority of the time, the fact still remains that they all fall under common archetypes and it gets a little too obvious at times. If you've ever watched a little programme called ""Lupin III."" you'll be quick to notice that Spike Spiegel bears somewhat of a resemblance to the much beloved Arsene Lupin III with a sense of humour to match (although nowhere near as exaggerated). For that matter, I guess you can say that Jet and Faye are more realistic versions of Daisuke and Fujiko if you want to keep making the comparisons (Jet/Daisuke being the voice of reason and Faye/Fujiko being the ""femme fatale"" so-to-speak). To be fair, I understand that Lupin III was one of the influences behind Bebop's creation. At the same time, I saw Lupin WAAAAY before I ever watched Bebop so the resemblance is rather uncanny to me. With that said, it's still nice to see an interpretation of Lupin, Daisuke, and Fujiko being played straight.
It's not like they remain static throughout the entire ordeal. With the exception of Edward who's more or less just the quirky and hyperactive computer genius (that still gets a bit of time in the sun regardless), everyone gets a fair amount of development and time on-screen so they're more than just the common archetypes like I've mentioned earlier and in some cases, actually feel like real people rather than you know... characters. With that said, let's talk about secondary/tertiary characters. A good chunk of the episodes introduce a new character whom the Bebop crew ends up dealing with for 20 minutes before their story is resolved by the end of the episode and they are quickly forgotten about. I suppose in that respect, Cowboy Bebop is similar to Mushishi. 
Unlike Mushishi however, Bebop actually does have recurring characters and they do what they do rather well without becoming a distraction. Of course, that still doesn't change the fact that I consider most of them to be like the cabbage merchant from Avatar: The Last Airbender. The standalone characters in Cowboy Bebop on the other hand are hit-and-miss for me. This goes back to the problem that most episodic shows tend to have with varying degrees in quality. Sometimes, I got REALLY attached to the character(s) introduced in one episode and was disheartened to never see them again and other times, the character(s) introduced in another episode were so dull to the point where I felt like the episode was dragging on. 
When it comes down to substance, Bebop falls a little flat so you may be wondering why you should even bother watching it if it's not the epitome of perfection. The answer is very simple: Cowboy Bebop is among the most influential anime of the 90s and its influence can still be seen to this day. In its heyday, Cowboy Bebop achieved a lot of success due to various factors. From its Space Western setting to the well-choreographed action sequences, a soundtrack composed by Yoko Kanno consisting of mostly Jazz and Blues tracks to an amazing English dub where everything was played straight and was allowed to air uncut due to the fact that it was the first anime series that [adult swim] picked up (coincidentally on the same night the network made its debut), it seemed like the odds were stacked in Bebop's favour from the very beginning. Let's not forget the aesthetics because it would be a travesty not to do so. 
For one thing, this is the best-looking TV show from the 90s without a doubt, and to this day it still looks amazing. It's one thing for digital animation to be fluid, but to see that same sort of fluidity with cel animation where each frame was drawn by hand without losing any sort of detail whatsoever really just shows the meticulous amount of time and effort the blokes over at Sunrise put into the art and animation. That's actually kind of funny (in an ironic sort of manner) given that Sunrise was kicked off the animation team for Batman: The Animated Series because of the fact that nearly all the episodes that Sunrise took a part in had to be redone multiple times (or even re-animated in America) because of the fact that virtually everything was off model. I'm guessing that they were basically looking for a way to get back at Bruce Timm and Paul Dini for kicking them off the animation team, so they decided to basically bring out their A-game to their next project which just so happened to be Cowboy Bebop.
Going back to the soundtrack, what I love most about it (aside from the fact that it was composed by Yoko Kanno) is the fact that the OST isn't an afterthought of any kind since there are multiple scenes throughout the show which forgoes dialogue completely and instead rely on the music to actually convey the moment. It's the little things like this that make it so much more difficult for me to pick who's my favourite composer since the only other composer I can think of who'd actually do such a thing would be Kenji Kawai given that there were similar moments in the Ghost in the Shell films. What's more is the fact that a combination of jazz and blues among other such genres really helped give this show a unique flavour which has yet to be mimicked. Say what you will about Samurai Champloo being a carbon copy of Bebop when it comes down to story/characters, but one thing's for certain: Bebop's style is something that Champloo just cannot imitate (and that's a good thing, since Champloo's got its own style which works amazingly well for it).
Another thing that Cowboy Bebop has going for it? An absolutely spectacular English dub which is so good to the point where dub haters generally make an exception for this show. This goes back to how everything was played straight in Bebop from the get-go. In the past, English dubs of anime varied quite a bit in quality. Some dubs like the DiC dub of Sailor Moon changed up the dialogue so heavily edited for content and censored to high heaven to the point where it makes 4Kids' One Piece dub blush. Other times, dubs were actually pretty damn good (such was the case with Neon Genesis Evangelion and Yu Yu Hakusho) but were unfortunately butchered when they aired abroad due to the fact that those shows were airing on children's programming blocks and standards back then were much tighter than they are now. That was never the case with Bebop since it was aired on an adult programming block and as such, it was able to forgo most (if not all) of the censorship regulations during its broadcast on [adult swim]. Aside from that, we also had wonderful voice actors working on this like Steve Blum, Wendee Lee, and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn (fun fact: McGlynn also directed the English dub of Bebop) and a slew of many others, all of whom gave excellent performances.
Aside from the visuals and the audio, what other merits does Bebop have? Well for one thing, its style is something that allowed it to achieve widespread success with Western audiences. It's impossible not to notice that a good majority of anime these days require you to have some pre-existing knowledge of Asian culture in order to properly understand what's going on. Haven't you ever wondered why films like Akira and Ghost in the Shell (and to a lesser degree, Studio Ghibli movies) were huge hits back in the day? It was mostly because these were films that nobody needed any knowledge of Japanese culture to enjoy. Yes, Akira and Ghost in the Shell both took place in Tokyo, but it was really the the concepts, the gloomy atmosphere, the action, the blood, etc. which drew in Western audiences. It was taking place in Japan, and yet it didn't really feel like Japan at all outside of naming conventions, but that's a minor detail in comparison to everything else. It helps that unlike the former two, Bebop actually had virtually all the signs, posters and such in-universe written in English rather than Japanese in the original dub. Don't even get me started on the subtle cultural references and its film noir overtones because if I did, you'd be here for hours reading this review.
So when you combine all these things together, it's no secret as to why Cowboy Bebop is as lauded as it is now. I can certainly see why it wouldn't really be everyone's cup of tea (especially given some of the flaws I mentioned earlier). Regardless, its influence can't be denied. For all its worth, Cowboy Bebop is certainly a show that deserves most (but not all) the praise it gets. I get the feeling that if it had more of a plot to it and didn't rely so much on being badass and awesome to make people forgive its lack of a plot, it would definitely receive more praise than it already gets. The stage was set perfectly, so I question why Wantanabe and the rest of the Bebop team decided to opt for a mostly episodic nature when the ones where the ""plot"" actually progresses were nothing short of spectacular. Oh well, I guess it's too late to find out why... unless Wantanabe decides to do to Bebop what George Lucas did to Star Wars. Thankfully, Wantanabe seems to have more integrity than that.
Anyway, that's it for my first review on this site. Please be gentle, senpai.... (>/////",8,filthyfuckinweeb,

                This is the best anime ever made.
Why?
Because it isn't anime.
There aren't any anime conventions in it. There is no anime soundtrack. There are no schoolgirls, no tsundere, no moe, no giant robots.
This is a TV show.Anyone can watch it and enjoy it.
It has a plot, but it's also episodic so you can just sit down and watch it. 
It's about bounty hunters, something Sergio Leone made popular--and put to good use here.
The characters are well put together with distinctive personalities (and an Homage to Lupin). Bruce-lee-esque Spike that looks like he's out of a 70s action flick, a Tarantino Movie, and stole his wardrobe from Lupin. Jet, the sensible foil to Spike--cop turned bounty hunter. Faye Valentine, the typical scantily clad woman. But her gambling problem, poignant backstory, and the fact she's out of place in the ""future"" world rounds her out perfectly. You could argue that the comedic ""Ed,"" a hacker child, is the least fitting out of the four, but honestly odd episodes like Mushroom Samba and when she searches for her father seem to redeem that. And finally there's Vicious, the cold hearted syndicate killer and perfect antagonist to Spike. His katana to Spike's guns.
The settings are our solar system in the near future, with creative takes on each planet/moon--everything is beautiful and fitting, like Mosques on Venus, a sprawling Mars, crater-ridden Earth. Nothing extravagant, but the backgrounds are always there, noticeable, and fitting for the story. Shootouts in cathedrals, homage to kung fu, Tarantino, Leone. 
This is good because it's derivative of things that work. It has a great jazz soundtrack that doesn't fall prey to squeaky j-pop music and also matches the mood. The backstory is a simple one of the betrayal between men and women. The pacing is fast and uncluttered. 
And the ending is satisfying.
This is also the only anime where the English dub is peerless and so much more fitting than the Japanese version.
Watch it in order, or just watch one episode.
If you have to buy just one anime for your collection, you can't go wrong with this--the replay value is excellent, like watching your favorite childhood action films on the weekends that you never get sick of.
This is the exception to anime, not the norm. 
And something like this comes out every decade or two. It's impossible not to enjoy. If anime was more like this than the shit that's around now, it wouldn't be seen as a distraction for socially maladjusted shut-ins.",10,tentacle_raep,

                At its core, Cowboy Bebop is the story of Spike Spiegal, Jets Black, Fay Valentines, Edward, Ion, Vicious, and Julia. But that's where the whole anime, in itself, drives a whole lot more in its 26 episodes. It leads us through a universe somewhere around 2080s space - I'm not sure, because in one episode one of the characters died in 2071 - where we still have the planets of the Milky Way, but because of the presence of orbital gates and space travelling and colonization, all the planets are now in themselves environments with interactive stories to tell. And yes, a lot of stories
                  happen in either the planets (Jupiter, or Mars, or Earth, or Pluto), or their moons (like Titan, for instance).
For instance, Cowboy Bebop doesn't refer to either Spike or Jet, but rather the spaceship they use which has been named ""Cowboy Bebop"". Now, unless you had seen all the episodes, this small little thing might have been missed out. Its not a spoiler by any means, but it is stated to illustrate how the anime is presented.
While it is preferred to watch Cowboy Bebop in sequence, the episodes themselves are arranged like vignettes with only the characters forming the core bond holding them together. All of them. In the case of Cowboy Bebop, the best thing are well developed characters, even when they occur for one episode only. They not only interact with their environment (like bounty hunting, or hacking systems, or going to bars to drink, or even casual conversations between non-interactive characters who are very minor, for instance), but even amongst themselves are very... organic.
While the fight scenes and battle sequences in Cowboy Bebop are limited, they are nevertheless well handled. My personal favourite fight scenes are from the ending moments of ""Hard Luck Woman"". But in terms of personal favourite episodes, I'd choose ""Pierre le Fou"", ""Cowboy Funk"", ""Mushroom Samba"", and ""Heavy Metal Queen"".
In terms of characters, however, I'll be sadly blunt here, and by saying so I do solemnly want to inform everyone reading this review, that this is a massive spoiler, so be warned: Julia is a bitch. I'll not tell you why, but after seeing Cowboy Bebop, you'll realize this as soon as you reach the arc ""The Real Folk Blues"".
Cowboy Bebop has its moments of contemplation, and it also has its moments of melancholy as well, but it does its best to integrate these alongside countless other emotions into the universe it is set in. Again, I repeat, the universe Cowboy Bebop is set in, is very dynamic, and in this anime it is very well executed.
This is a classic by many significant anime standards, and it doesn't come as a surprise why most traditional anime fans tend to bash modern ones. Its a timeless tale, and it is presented well. And it deserves to be recognized.
All in all, a deserving watch.",10,shehrozeameen,

                Shinichiro Watanabe's Cowboy Bebop is one of the legends of anime.  It's a program most anime viewers have heard of regardless of whether they've watched it in full or not and thanks to the multiple airings it's received over the years on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block it's a small number indeed who've never seen at least an episode.  I can safely say that before I purchased Bandai's recently released complete collection I'd seen most of the episodes on television in one order or another so I wasn't watching anything strikingly new but this does mark the first time I've watched Cowboy Bebop
                  in full from beginning to end in the order it was intended and as a result I feel I'm up to the challenge of writing a proper critique of what I saw.  The back of the case for my complete collection informs me that Cowboy Bebop was &quot;voted (the) greatest anime of all time!&quot;  Sale's pitches aside its an odd thing to say.  Unless you're a member of a doomsday cult I'd think it's safe to say we have a fair bit of time left till we have to decide what the greatest anything of all time was.  That said I had a lot of fun watching Cowboy Bebop and while I don't think it's one of anime's greatest contributions to visual media I can certainly see where it's reputation comes from.
Cowboy Bebop takes place in the year 2071.  Decades earlier a system of gates was established to allow for easy travel throughout the solar system.  However, due to a fatal instability in the gate system that was ignored by the contractors, a disaster known as the Gate Accident occurred.  As a result of the accident most of Earth's surface was destroyed and humanity spread out to more habitable places on or around other planets.  This leads to a kind of neo-Wild West scenario with the central government and law enforcement agencies in a weakened state leading to a kind of lawlessness.  It is an institutionalized system of bounty hunters that picks up the slack and this is the concept much of the program centers on.
The setting, as mentioned, is a kind of neo-Wild West in space, hence the &quot;Cowboy&quot; half of the title.  Unlike Trigun, for example, which takes place in a setting that, steampunk elements aside, is virtually identical to that found in American Westerns, Cowboy Bebop plays out in a setting very much like the present.  Its science fiction but the world is nonetheless recognizable as being our own.  Some elements stand out on occasion from the rest of the world as though they were transposed straight out of a typical American Western with little thought to consistency with the rest of the setting (for example the occasional conspicuous presence of individuals dressed in ponchos and sombreros), but it all works nonetheless to create an intriguing world for the story lines to play out in.
I tend to think that one the reasons for Cowboy Bebop's monumental success is the fact that it is a very fun, easy show to watch.  It doesn't make any demands on the viewer with its highly episodic nature and lack of any real overarching plot.  The closest Cowboy Bebop comes to having one is the story of Spike's past and even then it only occupies five episodes out of the total twenty-six. By and large, episodes either focus on the story of a specific bounty or on developing the main cast and their pasts and even though Spike's story is given the most attention it still suffers from the limited amount of time it receives.  In fact, if I were pressed, I'd have to say that the main story line is not exclusively about Spike's past at all but about everyone's.  The members of the crew of the spaceship Bebop all have troubled pasts which they all eventually have to face up to and that they will either overcome and move on or be destroyed.
To it's credit Cowboy Bebop possesses a well-developed essentially likable cast of characters.  Spike, Jet, and Faye are all interesting characters and even Ed, despite remaining largely a question mark throughout compared to the rest, is still a fun character to watch.  Problems arise, however, with members of the supporting cast, specifically those involved with Spike's past.  His past is revealed with a wonderful sense of subtlety throughout via the use of flashes of memory, succeeding to tell a complete story despite the time constraints.  However Spike's old associates from the Red Dragon syndicate don't come out so well.  Julia and particularly Vicious receive very little development.  Some characters from stand-alone bounty hunting episodes are more developed.  Often the most understanding that is provided about these characters comes solely from Spike&rsquo;s reactions to them which, to be fair, often proves to be enough.
On the audio/visual front Cowboy Bebop is quite the success.  Character designs by Toshihiro Kawamoto are consistently appealing and the animation is smooth utilizing a nicely done blend of two dimensional and computer generated animation.  For the purposes of this review I watched the dub for Cowboy Bebop which is regarded as one of the best with good reason.  All members of the cast fit their characters well and convey believable emotion when needed.  Yoko Kanno should need little introduction for her role in composing the soundtrack, focusing primarily on jazz while providing a fair variety of other genres throughout.  All in all a very high quality production even ten years later.
Overall, for me, Cowboy Bebop isn't a favorite, my main gripe being my issues with the story line.  However, despite that it proved to be a very fun, perhaps even addictive show to watch.  It has a wonderful soundtrack and a cast of characters well worth remembering after the final credit scroll.  For this I award it an overall rating of 8/10.",8,Isambard,

                     Cowboy Bebop is a household name to anime fans. Either you've seen it, or you've at least heard about it from your friends. Being one of the original anime aired in the US via Cartoon Network, it served as a gateway anime for many, a taste of what Japanese animation has to offer. Because of this, many people give it glowing reviews as a masterpiece, and a textbook example of what a good anime is. I am not of those people. I'm from the latter group of people, who heard the reviews about how good it was. So naturally, I
                  had to see if the hype train was real, if it's really that good, or if people think it's better than it really is because of the sentimentality of it being(probably) their first anime. Here are my thoughts:
Story:6
     The story of Bebop is a bit convoluted, in the sense that it's a roller coaster of fillerish material and key plot points. What I mean by that is that the series definitely has its ups and downs, with the down episodes seeming to have no point to the overall progression(essentially filler), and the up episodes having lots of action and plot in a 20 minute block(these are of course, sprinkled throughout the 26 episodes). While Bebop does a great job of tying everything together into a cohesive story by the end, I found that in the midst of it, I could never expect what was going to happen in the next episode, which makes it hard to follow the story as you watch it. So overall, the story overall is good, but falls apart episode to episode. I wish the main plot was emphasized more throughout the whole anime, as opposed to the last 4-5 episodes.
Art:8
     The artwork in this anime is good, so much so that I was surprised when i found out it was 15 years old. Obviously it won't look as good as your 2014 summer anime, but the art style definitely complements the overall feel of the anime. I think if you redid the anime with modern animation, it wouldn't hold up well at all. You pair a sort of western feeling anime with a sort of choppy grainy animation, and it definitely works. No complaints here.
Sound:10
     What I said for the art holds even more true for the sound. In my opinion, the sound is what really carries this anime. The music in this anime is very jazzy, ranging from upbeat to emotional pieces, from the sultry orchestral opening to the subtle guitar/piano background music scattered throughout. I don't think the creators could have done a better job of pairing music with animation, because the music really does set the tone well. Even if you're not the type to actively listen to the music in your anime, I bet you'd be surprised by how easily you could pick out a song from Bebop if you heard it somewhere else. Hell, I bet if you gave me a piano I could learn the opening by ear, and that's saying something. It's that memorable.
Character:7
     The characters in Bebop are a likeable motley crue of varying personalities. No one is particularly fascinating(although the dog Ein is hilarious), but no one is particularly boring either. They're just a very normal, dare I say average, group. No Makoto-esque characters that make you want to swallow a spoon and/or yell at your screen(damn you School Days), and no *Insert stereotypical heroine from harem anime here*-esque characters with the emotional depth of a puddle. I will say that the characters are developed well throughout the anime, so the filler I mentioned earlier did serve a point. Although, considering your main cast consists of 4 characters and a badass dog, character development should be a given considering 26 episodes is significantly longer that your typical 12 episode animes, and you've got such a small cast to work with.
Enjoyment:7
     I usually judge my enjoyment factor by how many episodes I can watch in a row before I want to do something else, with 1 episode being painful to watch(School Days, Aku no Hana) and 5+ being ""Holy shit! Is it that late already?!?""(A Certain Magical Index, Clannad). Bebop scores in the 2-3 range, usually 2. The reason I'm scoring that in the middle is because of the roller coastering(Adding that to dictionary) between episodes. You finish one episode that's awesome, and action packed, and makes you want to punch a stranger because ""fuck yeah!"".....and then the next episode is kinda boring. Usually I stop after a boring (and I'm using boring here to contrast the exciting episodes, not so much that the episode it self is terribly boring) episode, which is about every other episode.
Overall:7(Worth watching once)
     Overall, Bebop is a good anime. Is it worthy of the more recent Attack on Titan or Sword Art Online hype train that it still garners(For those of you who have been lambasted for not watching those while they were airing like me, you know what I' m talking about), I don't think so. It's worth a watch if you haven't seen it already, but it's not worth seeking out for anime enlightenment. It's not your anime Mecca, and I challenge anybody who thinks that it is to watch it again without bias, because I bet if you're one of the people who watched it when you were younger, you'll find that it's not as good as your remembered. You'll probably still enjoy it, but it won't seem as fulfilling the second time around.",7,Deadlynathan,

                &quot;The work which becomes a new genre itself will be called Cowboy Bebop&quot;
Cowboy Bebop is one of the few shows which can actually be called Epic.  Not an epic such as the Homeric poetry but epic as Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary says &ldquo;extending beyond the usual or ordinary especially in size or scope.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s a word that shouldn&rsquo;t be used lightly.  Cowboy Bebop is the standard by which Anime should be molded after.  It achieves near perfection in creation and at the end there is a feeling of fulfillment.  No other anime has a more complete and satisfying ending.
The story element is
                  where many great animes get their strength from but Cowboy Bebop is actually weakest here.  The story is very individualized, rarely do the events of one episode effect other episodes.  Yet despite this &ldquo;episodic&rdquo; design, actual plot is occasionally used and by the end it feels like the plot has always been a part of the show like a shadow that had just been noticed.  
In other anime I can&rsquo;t think of too many action scenes that can come even close to those in Cowboy Bebop.  Motion is almost always drawn smoothly and action scenes are incredible to watch.  As Spike says, &ldquo;like water.&rdquo;  The artists did a superb job in being able to create a certain mood through lightening and the vibrant/dull of colors.  The artwork altogether is incredible and visually everything feels natural.  
The sound was particularly enjoyable.  There was a good amount of jazz music which fits Bebop well due to the uncertainty which is the foundation of jazz music.  I wasn&rsquo;t too fond of the opening theme though(I&rsquo;m probably the only one).  But in eps 5 near the end and at the conclusion of eps 26, the music is beyond incredible.  It honestly speaks about the show in ways words could never describe and help elevate Bebop to levels rarely achieved.  But like I said, for some reason I hate the opening theme.  
Because the story is sort of &ldquo;weak&rdquo; the characters are the driving force of the show.  This is where Bebop is made.  The characters are all vastly different and don&rsquo;t really fit any particular clich&eacute;s, which is quite refreshing.  All you need to know is that you won&rsquo;t find more original and more entertaining characters anywhere else.
If this anime doesn&rsquo;t speak to you or inspire you, don&rsquo;t worry because it is extremely fun to watch.  Bebop won&rsquo;t put you in stitches for the full 20 minutes nor will it try to force you to enjoy the show.  Instead it does it&rsquo;s own thing and you can&rsquo;t help but smile while watching.  The Bebop crew is just pure fun and I guarantee you will enjoy it.
Conclusion:  Cowboy Bebop is not my #1 personal favorite show, but it is the most complete and perfect anime out there.  It is in all sense of the word, A Masterpiece.  Bebop may not be exactly what you want for an ideal story anime, but in no way does that take away from it.  The light hearted and random episodes are fun all the way through.  The characters are very likeable and create a great atmosphere.  The visual style and sound combine with the other elements in a perfect blend to make a perfect show (or as close as you can get).  This may not be your favorite show but you will not be disappointed and at the very least you will finish with a smile feeling as satisfied as if you finished eating a great meal.",10,Darkmage530,

                The story is pretty much episodic and not traditionally serial like the majority of anime. Each episode, they watch a show for bounty hunters that provide them information on the latest thugs that are out there ranging from petty drug dealers, to big time hitmen, and universally threatening terrorists. But I felt there are some certain episodes that the series could have lived without. Like episode 11 where a blob comes out of the refrigerator. 
What I really like about this anime is that it's very character driven. Like Spike despite having a very reckless nature and can crack wise jokes, tends to have a
                  very indirect and not so straight forward personality if you try to have a normal conversation with him. He&rsquo;s not really anti-social, it&rsquo;s just that he&rsquo;s not a people person, and is really private. Ed is just this whacky genius kid and you have no idea what goes on in her head. Faye is the freeloader. And Jet is who you can say is the parental figure aboard the bebop. These personalities equal to some very great chemistry and very realistic interactions because of how the characters express themselves and their general personalities. 
In terms of art and animation quality, this anime was the gateway between the 1990s and the new millenium. It perfectly mixes CG and 2D art. One of the other animes doing it that around this time was Initial D, which wasn&rsquo;t really as amazing as Cowboy Bebop&rsquo;s but still cool. But Cowboy Bebop just perfectly blended it together and did not make you lose a certain grip of what you were viewing. 
The action of this anime ranges from John Woo style explosive stand offs, aerial dog fights, and martial arts. So you&rsquo;re getting everything in terms of action. A lot of scenes were influenced by Kung Fu and John Woo movies. Like the climatic battle in episode 5 is based on John Woo&rsquo;s the Killer, and all of Spike&rsquo;s movements when he does hand to hand combat is all based on Bruce Lee. His footwork, his stances, the way he lunges, all of it. And of course Spike is a student of Bruce Lee&rsquo;s martial arts philopshy, Jeet Kune Do, meaning the intercepting fist. There is one episode where he tries to teach a guy martial arts and he even uses one of Bruce Lee&rsquo;s famous and iconic quotes of &ldquo;be like water.&rdquo; 
The design is very distinctive and the characters are diverse but you see some references to other animes in it. Like Spike&rsquo;s clothing style and his color scheme does pay homage to Lupin III. And I can&rsquo;t say for certain, but Faye&rsquo;s design does remind me of Major Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell with her look and the hair color being purple. The space ships are quite original and have a great design to them. They have excellent frames where it matches their aerial agilities in combat or in high speeds. 
Thanks to the addition of Yoko Kanno, then expect top notch music in this anime in its own respective style in compliments to the atmosphere. The jazz and blues soundtrack is one of the other most associative qualities this anime has that makes it so great. It flows so well with the action scenes by making you sit back and enjoy the excitement, and yet it also reflects the easygoing personality Spike still manages to maintain in his fights against tomato can opponents. And sometimes, it will have some more powerful sounding songs like Rain that goes so well with the scenery. Tank, the opening theme gives somewhat of an old school feel to it like you&rsquo;re watching a 1970s action movie and the song alone is good enough to show you&rsquo;re going to see something that goes beyond your expectations. 
Both the Japanese and English versions are excellent. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter what version you&rsquo;re going to watch because both tracks just do an accurate job of making you feel the characters. However, my only problem with the dub is that the black co-host in the bounty hunting tv show sounds more like a southern white guy. But moving on, both Koichi Yamadera (the voice of Ryoga in Ranma, Togusa in Ghost in the Shell, and Kaji in Evangelion) and Steven Blum really bring out Spike&rsquo;s laid back, humorous, serious, and not so straightforward personality. 
Seiyuu legend, Megumi Hayashibara (the voice of female Ranma, Rei from Evangelion, and Lina Inverse from Slayers) and Wendee Lee approach Faye&rsquo;s character as being mysterious, captivating, broken hearted, and yet is somewhat of a motivator. 
And Unsho Ishizuka (the voice of Miyata-san from Hajime no Ippo, Sasaki from History&rsquo;s Strongest Disciple Ken&rsquo;ichi, and Bunta from Initial D) and his English corresponding actor, Beau Billingslea, both do an excellent job of portraying Jet as being somewhat part comic relief, but yet has a grouchy personality at the same time and brings out the big brother/father figure to the Bebop. 
In the past, lots of people have talked about a sequel. This anime does not need a sequel. The ending is perfect. The director should not have gone out and said there is no conformation or any implication of what the ending really meant. I really love 100% conclusive endings. I rank this the 2nd best ending behind Ashita no Joe. But on the other hand, I can understand making a prequel. I&rsquo;d like to know how a run out cop and a runaway hitman teamed up to become bounty hunters. Like make a story of how Spike and Jet met. Make an OAV about Faye during her past. I like to know more about the characters to get a better understanding of them, and I feel this series would be a bit more complete, not saying the series is, but some of the small things did leave me curious. 
So if you like martial arts action, dog fights, John Woo, Dog the Bounty Hunter, sci-fi, and space opera mixed with a story that doesn&rsquo;t really have to be linear, but driven more by the characters, than this is for you. It&rsquo;s very, very great, but short of perfect.",9,ParaParaJMo,

                Cowboy Bebop is hailed as one of the greatest anime of all time, which acts as a testament to how the drug called nostalgia can be so addictive in clouding critical thought. It's by no means a bad series, but neither is it fully original nor amazingly executed.
If I were to sum up the series in several words, I would choose ""style over substance."" The art is good, as is the voice acting for both dub and sub, and the music is fantastic. However, those are just dressing for the feast that is a series and unless the actual meat of a series that is
                  plot and characters has much substance to it, there's little taste to gain from it's flavours overall.
That said, the plot can be hit or miss. I find the sci-fi setting to be decent, but it's not executed to anywhere near it's full potential. You won't be finding the thematic exploration that space can provide in series such as Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Gundam's Universal Century or Planetes, with the space setting being used primarily just to allow the series to stand out from the norm. There are story elements I do like, such as the ending being solid. However, most of the episodes are skippable due to the series' episodic nature, which shows how loose the narrative is. The majority of it tends to be just tributes to western cinema, which whilst nice, don't really offer much to the series itself.
The main drawing point for most is the characters, though even they aren't anything too grand. They are at least consistent, so none of them are bad, but the only one who stands out as being much more than average is Faye with her search for identity. Spike is alright with his dual nature of goofy yet experienced, though the trope has been done far better elsewhere such as Onizuka from GTO or Kenshin from Rurouni Kenshin. Despite the focus given to his past, especially in the last two episodes, we don't really get much in-depth exploration for his timeline or psychology. Jet is a stereotypical gruff guy with good intentions and Ed is just the trope of a child genius. Finally, there's the main villain of Vicious who, despite his history with Spike, has little personality to stand on his own as a character and purely serves as a foil to Spike.
The element of characters is still executed competently enough to place the series slightly above average, but that's about as high as it goes. It at least improved on the eccentric episodic ensemble of Lupin III as a purely fun series and as far as episodic space series go it surpasses Space Adventure Cobra due to character decisions having a permanent impact on the plot, but it's no golden standard for the medium. Overall, Bebop only really stands out as a case study in the history and rise of anime's popularity in the west and if wanting an anime with a wide array of themes and well-developed characters, there's the true peak of the medium that is Legend of the Galactic Heroes.

                Cowboy Bebop... widely considered as a masterpiece. I personally thought it was good, but I would have trouble placing it at masterpiece status.
I decided to watch Cowboy Bebop because it was done by Shinichiro Watanabe, who also did Samurai Champloo, which is one of my all time favorites. If you watched Champloo, Bebop is similar in that both follow an episodic format, where there is some kind of a story or plot, but the story itself is not as important as the journey. In Champloo, this was the search for the sunflower samurai. I guess in Bebop the main plot focus could be considered Spikes
                  backstory and the whole situation with Julia.
Cowboy Bebop is about bounty hunters Spike and Jet and there adventures as bounty hunters and the other bounty hunters, Faye and Edward who they meet along their journey.

I think the most interesting part of Cowboy Bebop is I guess the main protagonist, Spike Spiegel. Although I do not necessarily the episodic format to be a bad thing, I feel that it sometimes took away what was the most interesting part of the show, which for me was Spike's backstory. Spike is a very interesting character - he is very mysterious, not to mention that he is very skilled at his job.

-Spike Spiegel
Due to my increasingly robust backlog I rarely take the opportunity to rewatch an anime. For the sake of Cowboy Bebop, one of my few critically acclaimed series, I decided to make an exception. My re-analysis was sparked by a conversation I had recently with a friend, in which she asked me what I loved so much about the series. For some reason, I couldn't rattle off a list or even a few distinct reasons as to why I hold the series in such high regard. This led me
                  to grow curious of my thoughts if I gave it a re-watch. This was my gateway anime, the series that truly drew me to the medium in the first place, and I find it only fair to remove the nostalgia goggles for a bit and give this series a second look. Did it stand the test of time? Is it still a 10 out of 10? Well, there's only one way to find out. I'm reviewing this from a purely critical standpoint so it may get rather lengthy. Minor spoilers ahead.
Although it debuted in the late 90s, I was first introduced to Bebop about a decade ago, the summer of my junior year in high school (I realize I just dated myself). Up until that time I had always looked at anime as gimmicky or childish, cartoons lacking intellectual plot lines and flooded with girls sporting cat ears, with ultraviolent shock factor. When I had discovered Adult Swim on Cartoon Network, I was ecstatic. I would willingly stay up into the wee hours of the morning powering through shows like Bebop, Outlaw Star and Samurai Champloo, expanding my anime resume and loving every second of it. I think specifically in Bebop's case, the anime is subconsciously praised more for what it accomplished rather than its content. It helped spark a western anime revolution with entertainment fans in Europe and North America, creating a series approved by both avid anime connoisseurs and casual viewers. Not only did Bebop succeed, but it did so without tasteless fan service, harems, bad English voice acting or most anything else Americans commonly complain about in anime. In retrospect, I am so grateful to this series for opening my eyes to the medium and showing me how enjoyable anime can truly be.
When it comes to plot content, Cowboy Bebop is actually kind of bare-bones. The over-arcing storyline serves more as a backdrop then a focal point of the series. Spike Spiegel, a lethargic space bounty hunter stricken by the grief of losing his lover collects rewards from nabbing various criminals around the galaxy. His partner, Jet Black acts as the perfect balance in personality to Spike, exuding wisdom as well as common sense. They encounter a seemingly insurmountable amount of bad luck, pick up more crewmembers and come to terms with the ghosts of their past. Those ghosts are perhaps stronger for no one other than Spike, who has thoughts of his mistresse's killer looming in the back of his mind, waiting for a final battle with a one time friend spanning the length of the galaxy. Spike even sports a fake eye, a testament to his imperfection.
Throughout Spike and Jet's escapades in space, Cowboy Bebop explores a plethora of themes including loss, existentialism and loneliness. Each episode ebbs and flows with distinct tonal shifts accompanied by peppy jazz medleys along the way. The editing is quite fluid. I've always enjoyed the way this era of anime (Serial Experiments Lain, Visions of Escaflowne etc.) would create points of pondering or intellectual thought and didn't just slam the subject matter in your face. Although the anime is episodic in nature, this almost works to its advantage, adding snippets of various symbolism in its environment and dialogue. Even more cheeky episodes like the one where the crew discovers psychedelic mushrooms, help to illustrate the boredom one must face in the life of space. There are even moments where characters seem to be intoxicated or having some sort of transcendental experience, crafted almost entirely by the mind's ability to meander basically anywhere. Viewers have the unique ability to witness these themes vicariously through the crew and sympathize with them accordingly. This is definitely a quality of the anime I didn't appreciate the first time I watched it, but now that I'm older I do.
Another portion that works towards Cowboy Bebop's advantage is the lack of internal monologue with the characters. Instead of overtly telling the viewer what each character is thinking, the writers leave the inferring to our own minds. It's what some critics like to call the ""intelligence test"" with movies and TV alike. Sometimes monologues can detract from a series if not done properly or too often by taking the viewer out of an analytic role. Similar to this is how the entire environment is constructed. Everything feels very matter-of-fact, much like you're just dropping in as a fly on the wall with little or no introduction to the setting. The narrative is never ruined by a character abruptly stopping to explain something, which would be entirely unnecessary based on how well everything is illustrated in Cowboy Bebop. It gives you a warm fuzzy for how real life in futuristic space would be like. Even as the show concluded, with the lead character's fate being in question, there was no long drawnout speech, just the ending scenes for the viewers to decide the overall outcome. Bebop ends up being that show that can either be watched all at once or at a 1 to 2 episode a night speed. It's perfect to enjoy after a long day at school or work or just wanting to relax and enjoy some good quality entertainment.
In a perfect world an anime would balance intellectual and story driven elements with finesse. Unfortunately, this is one area that Cowboy Bebop suffers. If you don't appreciate the characters or get interested in the symbolism side of things, there isn't much else left to keep the anime afloat. Lucky for me I was able to appreciate the references and themes more this time around, so it didn't putter out or feel boring to me. There were instances where I became distracted, which were annoying, causing me to skip back and there aren't a lot of times where I was glued to my seat with excitement. It's one of those shows where you have to sit back and just take it all in, which isn't necessarily for everyone. The episodic approach offers multiple vignettes where a story is built up and concluded, all in 20 minutes.  This is a difficult task to tackle, which often lead to creating many one-dimensional villains and making me feel quite unattached from their cause, whatever it may have been. The ending also appeared to be more of a plot convenience than a justifiable conclusion.  It's almost as though Shinichiro Watanabe (director) ran out of storyboard and decided to put into place a rather cliche' ending on the series. These negatives stand out like a scratch on a new car, as they prevent the series from truly being a masterpiece. Most people would be apt to forget about these points however, since the general consensus is that Bebop is the pinnacle of Japanese animation.
The characters and Cowboy Bebop are undoubtedly one of the stronger points of the series. Watanabe did a great job of portraying the characters as relative opposites, in both demeanor and appearance. Spike is clean-cut with a dry personality, while Jet is patriarchal and political with a more rugged attire. Apparently Watanabe originally designed Spike to wear an eye patch, but the producers wrote it off early in development. Honestly, Jet serves as the entire parental unit a board the crew's ship. He's responsible, he cooks and is in charge of overseeing all the major repairs the ship undergoes. Faye, described by her Japanese voice actor as an ""ugly"" woman, does a fantastic job causing trouble and avoiding basically any responsibility for it. However, her enigmatic past makes her rather redeemable as a character and leaves a large area open for interpretation. There really isn't a heavily endowed, brain dead dame in Bebop. Speaking of enigmatic, the androgynous Ed has some mysteries of his own... or should I say ""her"" own. Dopey and unpredictable are just a few words to describe the hacker. Apparently, Ed's personality was crafted based on Yoko Kanno, the notorious composer of Bebop's OST. She must have been one interesting woman. Oddly enough, Watanabe originally proposed Ed as a male, but was gender swapped to even out the sausage fest. And let's not forget the most adorable anime pet in existence, Ein... the laziest/cutest data dog in the galaxy. Each of the characters exhibit some robust skeletons from their past and experience obvious signs of boredom and abandonment along the way. Spike's intriguing involvement with his rival Vicious is fueled by rage and revenge, two qualities not normally promulgated in Spike's personality. At the same time, It's a relationship I feel could've been expanded upon a little more. There are too many anime that falter when giving proper depth to antagonists, and Cowboy Bebop succumbs to the same issue.
If you hadn't already realized, the music is vital to Cowboy Bebop's storytelling and scene progression. Jazzy, upbeat tunes are juxtaposed with hand to hand combat and perilous situations, but everything seemed to click. Yoko Kanno had worked wonders with Sunrise Animations, and Bebop is quite possibly her magnum opus. It's one of the few anime soundtracks I could listen to standalone, without people questioning what the hell I was listening to.  It truly sounds like tracks out of a movie. Both the English and Japanese voice acting is impeccable, with props given to our lord and savior, Stephen Blum for his portrayal of Spike and Melissa Fahn as Edward. The OP is iconic, with superb, James Bond-like animation and the ED never really aged poorly for me. Overall, many present day anime could learn a thing or two about Bebop's music and how important it is to the series.  Without the soundtrack, this anime would ""ok"" at best. Animation has already been covered briefly, but I reiterate how well the artists created such a vivid depiction of space and the future. The character models were all very unique and their faces were emblazoned with personality.
Although I still very much appreciate this anime, I didn't enjoy it as much the second time around. Maybe it was half out of expectation or previous involvement, but something didn't feel as interesting to me. Still, I would urge just about any anime fan to check out the series if not already done. If for no other reason than to experience how great this time period was for anime in general, and how it paved the way for the growing industry. Like I previously stated, most people my age hold the series in such high regard due to pure nostalgia or how it opened their eyes to the medium of anime, I know it did for me. It's a series you can sit down and talk about even with non-anime fans, and believe me that's hard to find. I would prefer the series not be remade, as Watanabe suggests, but would be interested in a western, live-action adaptation. I think a successful American release of Ghost In The Shell will open the flood gates for future adaptations. As always, thanks for reading the review and be sure to check out my other works!",9,themegamancave,

                *SPOILERS FOR COWBOY BEBOP IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY SEEN IT SOMEHOW*
I'm sure that I'll hardly be able to add anything new here given that most of this show's praises have been sung more than the OST has been replayed by anyone who has seen the show, but what the hell? If Spike could go up against a Syndicate, then I can still find some things to say, at least presumably. Back to the preamble and enough of the rambling. Back in 1998, this wand the most popular show. Anime was just starting to really hit a boom with the US market, and back in the
                  day, this was like, the show you'd always sneak out to your friend's house or purposefully break your 9:30 PM curfew to watch if you were a kid in middle-school. Nowadays, it's one of the most celebrated anime to date, with thousands upon thousands of loyal fans who always spread the series like a loud bang from a gun in a giant echoing hallway with people in it who somehow rejoice the sound (if you get the inside joke I made). Now why is that? What makes this series stand out as one of the few classic anime (10+ years old defines a classic if it's often considered great) to make it to the top 30, among the likes of Code Geass, GTO, Spirited Away, and Legend of the Galactic Heroes? What makes this to often be considered Shinichiro Watanabe's magnum opus? Well, let's find out, shall we?
STORY: 10/10
A large chunk of this series is set on individual missions for the Bebop crew to try and make some money off of, usually to fail due to unforeseen circumstances, like their bounty dying, or someone screwing everything over for them, or whatnot, and a lot of them are fairly episodic. Sure, a lot of them are used to flesh out bits and pieces of the Bebop crew in sometimes tragic ways, but there are just there to fill up the run time, at least that's what it feels like. The ultimate plot behind it is that Spike Spiegel was once part of the Red Dragon Syndicate, but after Julia starts falling in love with Spike, Vicious loves up to his name and takes everything over and chases after Spike, so in order to escape, he fakes his death and joins up with former cop, Jet, and together, become bounty hunters, or Cowboys, if you will. After some missions gone awry, a dog, a troubled gambler who was in cryostasis for 70 or so years, and a genius hacker who is also a little girl, all join the crew, to Spike's initial dismay. Before I dive into the real meat of what makes the narrative of the show so special, I have to call attention to their taste in music and culture as a whole, with each title being a reference to a song or even a style or genre of music, as well as episodes that are blatant references to certain types of film, like Mushroom Samba's blacksplotation or the city noir crime detective style of Ganymede Elegy. It's always fun to see a show's episode titles have that much care and style put into them, especially when there are series out there that put no goddamn effort into their episode titles at all.
This series does a great job fleshing out the characters piece by piece, revealing how tragic their back stories are, like those of Jet up until his individual episode in episode 10 and Faye until hers in episode 18 with the video tape from her childhood, which has to be one of the saddest moments in the show. This series also likes to convey emotion more than anything else, specifically the various emotions you experience through life, without resorting to melodrama, which is rather refreshing for a show that relies mostly on pathos, with scenarios like the bell peppers and beef scenes surrounding a tragic case in the first episode, as to signify that this is the crew's way of trying to let it not get to them as they live another day scraping by; eating while trying to put everything past them in order to not be miserable, even after the crew splits temporarily in episode 23. Episodes 12 and 13 are where things start taking a turn for the darker, as after another square off with Vicious, we start truly learning of how badly everyone has it, except arguably for Ed. Admittedly, we already got to see it with Jet a few episodes prior, but that's 1 out of 3. The first time we really get to see the overarching narrative for Spike is in episode 5, and this is sort of taking a back seat for more adventures and scenarios that flesh out everyone. In episode 24, we finally meet Julia, and this is the point where everything comes spiraling down, as in the last 3 episodes, the crew eventually splits for real, Spike meets Julia again, Vicious truly takes control of the syndicate by force, Julia is killed, and Spike storms the syndicate to face off with Vicious once and for all before dying by saying us catchphrase to the cops that surrounded the building, culminating in one of the best ending in anime akin to the likes of Gurren Lagann, and again, Code Geass. ""You're gonna carry that weight"" has been ingrained in the minds of just about everyone who has seen this show since, like the characters, we gotta live with our life choices as some of them come back to haunt us, a message that's infinitely more poignant for adults as they've already started coping with this.
CHARACTERS: 9/10
The Bebop crew is widely considered to be one of the most iconic main casts in anime history, and for damn good reason, from their lavishly executed backstories, to their charismatic nature. The man who embodies this most of all is of course, Spike Spiegal, a total badass who hates kids, pets, and women with annoying attitudes. He kicks ass with style and smoothness akin to Bruce Lee (even paraphrasing him and having a similar fighting style), and generally comes off as someone you wanna see in just about any scenario life can bring, which this show is always more than happy to oblige. He has this sort of charisma ther just gels with his combat. It sucks that his past sucks, but that's a key part of the show; that your past will always come back to haunt you until you put it to rest. Jet Black is a former cop who cooks bell peppers and ""beef"" (cuz there is none), and is a very stern man who hates it when Spike goes off on his own, because it often screws with the mission, and with the money. It's always fun to see the two interact, and in fact, it's always fun to see him interact angrily with anyone, and that's surprisingly hard to get right. Then again, this is Cowboy Bebop.
Faye Valentine is a gambler with an attitude, and a charming mistress who was in stasis for 70 years, uses gambling to wash it all away after the pain of being deceived by a man she was growing affection for in this new, advanced, and alien age. I think what really makes her the most depressing of it was is seeing what an adorable child she was and not only how much everything about her childhood home and friends have changed and disappeared, but just how much darker and more scheming she became. Ed is a hacker who, unsurprisingly, acts like a child, and even plays with the dog named Ein, since of course, he is one. All of them are really likable characters for different reasons, even of most other characters don't have enough screen time for us to really connect with them, especially when some of them die. Though, that's kind of the point. We see the crew having small interactions with these guys we'll rarely see again. Just like the crew, we're just people wandering into the tail end of their now tragic life stories, with one exception: Vicious. A renegade syndicate member who wants revenge and control, feeling betrayed by Julia's affair with his best friend Spike. A typical setup for the hellish rivalry between two friends. Overall, this still quite a lovely cast, especially the awesome and emotionally broken Bebop crew. If they didn't have such bad luck with cases, I'd bet lots of us would wanna join them.
ART: 10/10
Some of you may be (unjustly) disconcerted by how old and classic the artstyle is, but this is one of the most fluidly animated shows I've ever seen, surpassing the likes of FLCL, and for it to keep that up for 26 episodes, two whole seasons of anime, is damn impressive. The mid 80's to late 90's perfected anime shading, and this was one of the lucky series to recieve such treatment, especially when it comes to the small ship Spike often pilots. Hell, it looks more polished than most anime today, and it's been nearly 2 decades since this show aired. The show's rendition of the clsssic visual technique of Itano Circus (coined and originated by the legendary Macross franchise since its original installment), shown off in episode 4, is a sight to behold, as are the amazingly fluid fight scenes. Then again, considering how fluid Spike's Bruce Lee inspired fluid fighting style, it's only natural that the series would go that far. The character designs also look both impressively stylish as well as realistic, the latter of which is something you don't often see in anime. The OP in particular as this type of jazzy flare to the art that you'd never see in any other OP, and the ED has blue images, complementing the song's name. The explosions and action look very gritty, really nailing the impact of whenever someone chucks a gernade in the middle of a fight, and overall, this show is definitely worth watching for the crisp and fluid visuals alone.
SOUND: 9/10
The soundtrack was done my Yoko Kanno, and that just sells the show right there, doesn't it? A lot of the OST, while not inherently memorable, definitely captured whatever scenario the crew finds itself in during any given episode. Plus, with emotional songs like ""Green Bird"", ""Stella no Moor"", ""Memory"", Waltz for Zizu"" (hey, Digibro used it emotionally), and ""Good night Julia"", how can you go wrong? The OP, ""Tank"" done by The Seatbelts, is a very cool and slick jazz song that amps you up for the show perfectly. You might find it contradictory that I said a lot of tracks aren't that memorable, only to list a lot of really amazing tracks, but there are so many pieces in the show that for even a decent fraction if the OST to be amazing, is to show how amazing it is as a whole. The ED on its own is pretty good, but the moment your tears truly fall is when you hear the full version of the ED ""The Real Folk Blues"" by The Seatbelts FT. Mai Yamane, which is a beautifully done emotional song with a final 2 minutes they can release the feels epically. 
The dub is often heralded as one of the best of all time, and I can't really disagree. It's up there with the likes of Gurren Lagann in terms of dub, which is really fitting given how amazing both shows are. All of the voices sound truly real, more so than most dubs or most performances of any show, and it all gels really well. Steve Blum does Spike Spiegel, and if you're a straight girl, you probably felt pleasure from that fact alone given this man's voice. Everyone else does a really great job as well, and rarely does it fell awkward in the slightest. 
ENJOYMENT: 8/10
Like I said, some of the middle episodes were almost fillery, and a bit boring (namely Mushroom Samba) but it was all worth it, not just for every episode that revealed much of any character's past, but also for the final few episodes. The show is smooth, and slick, like a good jazz song, and it often carried me through some of the weaker moments, followed by some really strong emotional moments. The show is definitely an entertaining one, and the badass yet tragic finale was definitely the highlight of everything. Looking back on and/or rewatching the show is when you truly appreciate the show's brilliance, and I wouldn't mind rewatching it sometime in the future.
OVERALL: 9/10    RAW SCORE: 92/10
This is definitely an impressive show that Watanabe worked on. It may not be a personal favorite, but I can easily see why someone would list it as one of theirs. It does a great job presenting the many different emotions of life, and does it brilliantly. Definitely a worthy show for anyone, especially one who loves to experience sci-fi. If you watch this show, you're gonna carry the weight, just like the rest of us. With all that said, I bid you adieu.",9,CodeBlazeFate,

                Do you miss the days where outer space felt like a place where people went to work, did their laundry and lived their average lives, instead of a futuristic, chrome-plated, automated, flashing, beeping gadget? I certainly do. Titles like “Star Wars” made space feel like someplace that you might live someday, instead of a place where everything was shiny and new, and nobody ever had to do manual labor. Cowboy Bebop is on to something with the way it portrays outer space. At least, that’s what avid fans of the series may tell you.
Being one of the more popular anime titles out there, does it
                  really live up to all the hype? Hopefully, this review will answer some of those questions for you. Diehard fans of the series may not like some of the things that I’m about to say, just to give you fair warning.
Story (4/10)—Whoa, hold on a second! Didn’t you just spend the first paragraph of this review praising the anime? Yes, people who inevitably will question me, I did. However, this particular chunk of the review won’t be so lavish with praise. 
Allow me to explain myself. The 4/10 makes it look like I hated this show. Let me assure you that I did not hate it.
The story of Cowboy Bebop takes place, you guessed it, sometime in the future in outer space. It follows the adventures of a bounty hunter named Spike and his buddy, Jet, a fellow bounty hunter. While this sounds like a stereotypical journey through space boredom, it’s actually quite refreshing. Spike and Jet live in a space world that somehow reminds you of the old west. The entire start of the story just feels organic. You get a good sense of who the two characters are, and what they’re doing.
So, why have I given the story such a low score? Well, quite simply, it was the startling lack of depth to the story that killed it for me. For the first several episodes, the show feels, well…episodic. There isn’t really a whole lot of story to connect the events of the first several episodes together. The only real common thread is Spike and Jet collecting bounty after bounty. Now, much to my surprise, this actually wasn’t a bad thing at first. I can deal with a few episodes where the plot isn’t apparent yet, if done well. And these episodes were! There were very good, and quite fun to watch! The atmosphere drew me in, the characters were intriguing, and the action was well-executed.
However, as any viewer will, I eventually began to get curious about the past of the characters, and how they’ve come to be where they are now.  After a few episodes, you finally start to get a few painfully brief glimpses into Spike’s past as he comes face to face with an old enemy. However, this tension is quickly dropped in favor of some more episodic adventures.
Fast forward another several episodes, and you get some more overarching plot involving this aforementioned villain. This particular adventure is split into two episodes, which got me very interested. However, the story drops the overall plot AGAIN and doesn’t pick it back up until the final two episodes. I really am not exaggerating, folks; aside from an occasional, brief flashback, the entire plot takes place in the space of about five episodes. 
So what are the other twenty-one episodes? Well, most of the other episodes are fun little adventures that involve some new villain every time, and put the characters in some sort of funny/amusing situation. Enough for some people, perhaps, but not for me. What really hooks me into a show is good, solid, well-planned plot. And Cowboy Bebop plain and simply failed to deliver. And on top of all that, the ending is…well, to avoid spoilers, let’s just say I didn’t care for it.
Basically, I was sitting there frothing at the mouth, episode after episode, saying “Where’s the plot? When does the plot start to form?”. And then I was left with precious little plot at all, only to be disappointed by the ending. It’s like if you’re at a restaurant and they give you a salad, and I mean a really, REALLY delicious salad as an appetizer, but when you finish your salad and keep asking for the main course, they just give you more salad instead. Then, once you’re starting to get sick of salad, they hand you a stale pop-tart as dessert and send you on your way. What? Where’s all the good stuff that I came here for?
That’s exactly how I felt at the end of Cowboy Bebop. I felt dissatisfied, and I felt like a great group of characters with good back stories, a very good atmosphere, an interesting villain, and some really solid action scenes had all simply gone to waste. I think that’s why I dislike the story so much. It got my expectations so high because the first few episodes were so good, only to disappoint me in the end.
Art (10/10)—See? There WERE things I liked about this show!
 Cowboy Bebop really is a gem among animation. Mind you, this anime was released in 1999, and the animation is STILL better than half of the stuff that’s released today. Every motion is fluid and smooth, and I never noticed any instances where the animation was lazy, or where the creators cut corners to save time or money. What really gets me is how some objects, like spaceships, were drawn without computer animation. Most animators will use computers to animate something with many moving parts, but not Cowboy Bebop. And in the instances where computer animation is used, it often took me several times to actually notice it.
Everything about the animation in this show is superb, from the characters, to the background, to the dark color palette that makes up the show. There were times when I wanted to pause the video just so I could stop and look at all of the beautiful details in the background. All in all, the art creates a very convincing atmosphere that makes you feel like you really ARE in space with the characters. 
Sound (10/10) — I really don’t think you can find an anime with a better score than this one. I’m completely serious. I know that it’s a bold claim to make, but the music is absolutely sensational! Remember how I keep blabbing on about what great atmosphere this show has? Well, the music is largely a part of it. “Tank”, the opening theme, is one of the most popular opening titles in the history of anime, and nearly every other bit of music is as fun and addicting to listen to as the title. This is easily the strongest point of the show, and was a large part of what I enjoyed while watching it.
For the first time, well…ever, I watched this series entirely in English. I was shocked to discover that the English dub of this show is VERY good. I’ve heard rumors that the creator of the show likes the English voices better than the Japanese, but I’m not certain of whether it’s true or not. In any case, you won’t be disappointed if you watch this show in English. I’ve never heard such a skilled cast of voice actors put together for any English dub, and never even once stopped and thought about the voice acting being poor. I can’t speak for the Japanese voices, but I’ve heard that those are quite good as well. No matter how you watch it, you’re not likely to be disappointed by the voice actors.
Characters (6/10)—The first rule of creating any workable story is that the characters must be believable. And, largely, the characters of this show fit that mold. In addition to Spike and Jet, there are two other members that make it onboard to become part of the crew, and although these characters spend the majority of the time being annoyed with one another, you’ll still find yourself liking them and laughing at their dynamic they share. Each character gets at least one episode devoted to exploring their back story, which is a significant chunk of time, considering the short length of the show. 
Thus, each character was fleshed out very well by the end of the series, and I found myself caring about each of them, even the ones who had annoyed me at first. However, by the time the plot starts to wrap up in the last two episodes, I came to realize that the relationships between the characters weren’t really going anywhere. One character whom didn’t give a rip about Spike at the beginning, actually started to care whether he existed or not by the end. Spike doesn’t seem to care at all, and what could have made for a very interesting moment between two characters was thrown out the window when Spike walked away.
I think my biggest reason for the low score was at the end, how so little emotional catharsis was achieved. Spike spends most of the series remembering a woman he loved, but the ending doesn’t really do much to take care of all that pent-up emotion. Even when Spike has that inevitable facedown with the villain at the end, I still didn’t feel like anything had really been achieved. Yes, I suppose the plot had technically been resolved, but what about my beloved characters? How do they react to all of this? Well, I hope you didn’t care about them, because the show never tells you.
It’s that stale pop-tart showing up again. Not only do you get an unsatisfactory ending plot-wise, but the show NEVER tells you what happens to the other characters! Even if they had all died, I still would at least have known what happened to them. However, the ending focuses solely on Spike, and even what happens to him leaves a little room for interpretation and guesswork. I suppose that’s why I disliked the plot so much. I felt like the characters that I knew and loved weren’t done justice by the ending.
Enjoyment (7/10)—This anime left me torn. I loved the music. I loved the art. I loved the characters. I even loved the first few episodes of the show, but I just felt like the ending let me down. Ultimately, I did enjoy the show, despite the many flaws I pointed out.
Overall (7/10)—So now it’s time to answer the question I posed at the beginning: is this show overrated? My answer would be a tentative “yes”. While there are aspects of the show that I didn’t care for, namely the plot, I still really enjoyed it, and the music definitely lived up to the hype.
Ultimately, I’d say this show is definitely worth watching. I just feel like whenever a show gets as much hype as this one does, people are bound to be disappointed once in awhile.",7,milkman57,

                Cowboy Bebop. Perhaps the greatest anime TV show created thus far. It's a massive mixture of genres, but is mostly sci-fi, comedy and action with a western vibe and a touch of film noir.
The story of Cowboy Bebop, or the lack thereof, is probably the weakest link to the series. This series does not have an ongoing story. However, the story is NOT the main focus of the show. Each episode can stand on its own.
The main focus is the immense variety of entertainment that this show provides. Many episodes are done in a different style. Some are dedicated to character development (what I call
                  the chill-out episodes), some are dedicated to character back-story (each main character gets about 2 or 3), some are dedicated to pure action and fun, while some are psychological thrillers or even social commentary.
The second main focus is the characters. Each main character is very well developed by the end of the series. It seems that the creators found the perfect kind of characters that would compliment the crew of Bebop. And what's this perfect formula? Contrast. Each character in the crew of Bebop has a very unique personality. Putting characters that do not fit together creates very interesting and funny situations, indeed.
The music is top-notch in this show. It ranges from jazz, funk and bebop to pop, classic rock and choir singing. Very memorable and compliments the scenes well.
By the time you finish this series, you will probably remember many of the times where the crew were just hanging out, living their everyday life. I think these scenes are what make the show. It wouldn't be the same without this contrast to the action throughout the show.
Overall I give Bebop a 10 out of 10. It's extremely enjoyable; the production design is amazing, and it has lovable and memorable characters, as well as amazing music that perfectly compliments the show.",10,RangFlash,

The 90s were a great time for anime. There was  DBZ, Yu Yu Hakusho, EVA, Sailor Moon etc. all were very good shows in their own right and garnered millions of fans worldwide. I am not here to talk about those, I here to talk about Cowboy Bebop, a timeless classic which was probably the reason why many people became interested in anime. Ah, I remember staying up until midnight, waiting for Cowboy Bebop to show
                  up on Toonami. Ah the memories...............but I digress.
Story- Now the revolves around a crew of space bounty hunters, whos main goal is to amass a large amount of money so they can live lavishly. It starts out with the main protagonist, Spike Speigel and his older buddy/pilot of their ship, Jet. Eventually, their crew expands to about 2 other people and also a dog. They go around the galaxy going on a bunch of crazy and wild adventures.
The show is episodic. It is not like one hugeeee long arc about one thing; each episode focuses on a specific adventure that the crew goes on, or them trying to deal with their past. Sometimes you will see Spike battle a fat, sociopathic killer with amazing strength, and other times you will see characters reflect upon their past as a means of catharsis. But, at the very end you will witness one of the greatest endings in anime history. Ask anyone who has seen Cowboy Bebop, they will agree.
Art- The art was very good for its time, and it even holds up well today. It is very crisp and you can tell from the detailed character drawings and ship designs. The show is also very ""western,"" themed, as in like Cowboys from the olden days. 
Sound- The soundtrack is amazing, it is a unique blend of jazz, blues, music-box etc. It is very eclectic to say the least. It is worthy of its widespread acclaim.
Dub over sub for this one. This only do to one person, Steve Blum one of the greatest voice actors of all time. His performance as Spike is what made him what he his today.
Character- It is probably one of the more popular casts in anime. First you have Spike, cynical, sarcastic bad ass with a shady past. Next, you have Jet Black, pilot of the Bebop and a grizzled ex-police officer. Third, you have Faye, sexy, and manipulative con woman. Fourth, you have Ed, the 
androgynous, whacky computer hacker. Lastly, we have the dog Ein, a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. This seemingly mis-matched group of rag tags, could not be more perfectly put together in my eyes.
Overall I give this show a 10/10  because it in all honesty it is a great show to watch. I will say that some people may find it  to be boring, so don't  watch it if you don't like shows with a focus on dialogue. This is a show that you should recommend to anime newcomers.",10,PoeticJustice,

                As an avid movie watcher and music lover, Cowboy Bebop was the first anime I've ever seen, with the perspective that I was about to see an anime. Of course, before this experience, I had already watched stuff like Dragon Ball or Doraemon, but those don't really count, because I never really watched them from a critical and artistic point of view. From the time I first finished Cowboy Bebop, I've watched several other anime and even rewatched Cowboy Bebop a second time. Because Cowboy Bebop is so special, both on a personal level and as an anime, I will be using an unconventional order
                  to review it.
----- Soundtrack (10) -----
I've heard many skeptics say to me that Cowboy Bebop is a silly name for a show, and that it drives them away from watching it. I completely disagree with these opinions, as I think the name Cowboy Bebop is the perfect name in regards to the show's soundtrack. If you heard a fragment of the soundtrack, you'll probably know what I am talking about. The bebop part emphasizes the jazzy influences of this amazing soundtrack (Bebop is a style or variation of jazz), Cowboy epitomizes all the adventures that this musical masterpiece will bring you.
With over 6 hours of absolutely splendid tracks, if you truly enjoy music, you'll be sure to never forget this soundtrack. Tracks like Spokey Dokey, Space Lion, Waltz for Zizi or Farewell Blues are some of the absolute masterpieces to be found among the rest of the equally excellent songs.
The true motivation for me to watch Cowboy Bebop was the grand opening, Tank. Some years ago, Cowboy Bebop was running on my television and from time to time I would listen to the mystical theme song, that wouldn't leave my mind for a long time. This truly inspired me to delve into the world of anime.
I have yet to find a soundtrack as influential and as inspiring as Cowboy Bebop's. No movie, series or anime will provide you with such an outstanding selection of songs. Even if you haven't watched Cowboy Bebop yet, I strongly recommend that you explored the music behind it, even though all of these songs become much more meaningful if you actually watch Cowboy Bebop.
----- Animation (9) -----
In my opinion, this is the only aspect of Cowboy Bebop that is not flawless. This, of course, doesn't remove the fact, that the art department of Cowboy Bebop is still very good, considering its age and the fact the it is mostly hand drawn. Having this in mind, everything looks damn good. However, some of the CGI didn't age very well (even though it is good CGI for the era) and some of the secondary characters could have been given a better look to match their great persona. This isn't the rule, and it certainly doesn't affect the show overall, but it does happen one or two times (Udai Taxim, I am looking at you).
One of the things I've liked about Cowboy Bebop was the fights. You rarely get lost in the action like many shows and they are usually smoothly animated and very enjoyable.
All in all, Cowboy Bebop looks pretty darn good and its visuals certainly match the rest of the theme going on.
----- Story (10) -----
The story of Cowboy Bebop is not an easy one to explain to people who have never seen it. This is mostly because Cowboy Bebop presents a multitude of small stories that build the individual stories of Cowboy Bebop's main characters. It is common for the people who haven't watched Cowboy Bebop to think the show is about some western showdown, but this certainly is not the case. To clear any misconceptions, our main cast consists of bounty hunters and not cowboys. The only true cowboy is Andy, a character who appears late on the show.
I would like to sum up some of the aspects explored in Cowboy Bebop:
1 - The entirety of the series happens in the future at our solar system. One of the fascinating things about Cowboy Bebop is how much our solar system has changed and how you would think human's old habits would be extinct after evolving into a interplanetary civilization. Cowboy Bebop is the story of an expanding and never learning human society.
2 - Cowboy Bebop follows the adventures of a crew of struggling bounty hunters. They are bounty hunters by chance and not choice as you will quickly learn. Together they roam our solar system in hopes of cashing bounties. Cowboy Bebop is the story of The Bebop spaceship.
3 - There is a man merely living a dream. Cowboy Bebop is the story of a man trying to wake up from that dream and get the life he once promised to himself.
I could go on and on writing about all of these things happening on Cowboy Bebop's universe, but these are just some of the more relevant ones.
Lastly, I'd like to add the amazing endings that of most of the episodes have. One could easily compare the format of Cowboy Bebop to that of short stories. A typical episode builds up to great climax and resolution, with lyrical prowess.
Everything in Cowboy Bebop is there for a reason. All the dialogues are meaningful, everything has its place and symbolic reason. The best way to describe Cowboy Bebop is that it is a truly amazing and artistic adventure.
----- Characters (10) -----
I could go on and speak about the characteristics of the main characters, but that really isn't necessary, because as soon as you start watching Cowboy Bebop you understand what they are all about. What really matters is why they act the way they do. What motivates their actions? Why did they end up being bounty hunters? These are questions that are covered perfectly, to say the least. I think one of the best experiences of Cowboy Bebop is you getting to know the crew and not having other people present them to you, so I won't write about these characters, as I think getting to know them is part of the magic of Cowboy Bebop. However, I should praise the supporting cast of Cowboy Bebop. Even though most of the supporting cast rotates and ends up making only one appearance, it is truly amazing how much depth and personality that these characters have. Hell, even the Big Shot presenters are really nice characters!
Funnily, when I discuss Cowboy Bebop with other people, I always get a different answer in regards to who their favorite characters were. Cowboy Bebop is one of the few shows that can achieve this sort of phenomenon and I can safely say that it will provide you with some of the best characters in any art media.
----- Enjoyment/Last Thoughts (10) -----
If you couldn't already tell, I really enjoyed Cowboy Bebop. It was a completely refreshing experience for me, as someone who was used to watch a lot of movies. As many have said it before, there is always something to be enjoyed by everyone in Cowboy Bebop. Even if you don't enjoy it as much as I did, I am sure you will at least like Cowboy Bebop, unless you are completely insensitive to art, because that is what Cowboy Bebop is - a masterpiece.
What I am about to say is a bit harsh, but it is true. I respect a lot of opinions, but one that I can't respect at all is that Cowboy Bebop isn't good or that they didn't like it. People who present you with this opinion are not only insulting their own intellect, but also probably didn't watch the entirety of Cowboy Bebop or didn't understand (which isn't hard) what Cowboy Bebop is about. If those aren't the answers you are probably talking to a very shallow and intellectually lacking person, but then again, these people should never be given your friendship. Yes, this is how much Cowboy Bebop means to me and to a lot of people. This is how good Cowboy Bebop is.
----- Should you watch it? -----
Absolutely. However, you need to take an artistic approach to the series, as, unlike many other popular anime, Cowboy Bebop is not completely linear and it provides a more balanced experience of action and story development.

                This is the quintessential anime. Yes, you heard it. The perfection in every way.
A one time in a lifespan journey. A diamond in the anime world. A chest full of gold buried in a very deep hole that everyone forgot about. This is Cowboy Bebop.
By the year of 2014, many people would rather watch One Piece or SAO or whatever they watch thats new, instead of watching Cowboy Bebop since its outdated to say the least. It doesn't have a sharp animation and the drawing is no way near what it is today. Well, if you think like this, then fuck you. You don't deserve
                  to experience what this masterpiece has to offer. The other ones who can get past its look, be sure that the reward is higher than that.
Cowboy Bebop doesn't follow a typical story, which only adds to its uniqueness. Its episodic and that means every episode = a new story to be told in this MASSIVE universe. Its strange how no one wants to do another series in this universe, not following the past characters. But i can understand that, because no one will repeat the succes of what Shinichiro Watanabe and Yoko Kanno did. Nonetheless, every episode is interesting and i wasn't bored a single time.
The Art is amazing, but i can see that someone will not like it. Well, good then.  The future is still very believable and i'd rather have this future than Star Wars and such.
The Sound is as good as it gets. Seriously. No other anime has what CB has packed in 4 discs i believe. The Jazz... enough words.
The Characters deserve a special spot in my soul. I will always remember the charming Spike, experienced Jet, lost Faye and crazy Ed.
This is without a question, the best anime out there. Go watch it right now. You can thank me later.",10,UsualGuy,

                Imagine Bruce Lee and Quentin Taratino's love child grew up and decided to make an anime after viciously fighting tigers in a jungle with nothing but a sharp stick. Ladies and gentlemen, that anime would be Cowboy Bebop. I often view Cowboy Bebop as the ""devil"" of anime. Not because it's particularly bad, but in fact it's quite the contrary. When you sign a deal with the devil, what happens? You get what you want, and the devil gets your soul. And in this case, you get the best entertainment you'll ever have in your life, but your soul is now being vastly devoured by
                  anime shows. 
Story: 9/10 - Cowboy Bebop is a bit different than other anime because it's plot vastly depends on the episodes (rather than it being a continuous plot throughout the series), to the point where it kinda mirrors a lot of American cartoons in it's story telling format. However, I still do HIGHLY recommend you watch all the episodes. Not only are all of them tremendously entertaining, but a lot of elements from certain episodes come back later as important plot. The overarching plot is pretty simple, the show follows two partners: Spike and Jet who've had rough pasts and run off to become space bounty hunters in a future society where inter-planetary travel isn't just possible, but also widely used. Overtime there spaceship (the Bebop) gains more and more members: A women with and attitude (Faye), a corgi with enhanced intelligence (Ein), and a superhacker (Who is just a little girl with SEVERE ADHD named Edward). 
Art: 10/10 - The art itself especially deserves praise because Cowboy Bebop came out before digital animation was widely used... and it's STILL better animated than a hell of a lot of modern anime. The fight scenes are still very fluid for it's time and still holds up to the very day. 
Sound: 10/10 - Want to hear the best fucking dub in existence? Look no further than Cowboy Bebop. This show has vastly been considered to have the best dub in anime history, and it came out an era where not much was expected in the dubbing process. As for the soundtrack? Well, Cowboy Bebop relies heavily on it's music as it's loaded with jazz/blues. And if you're a music fan this anime is LOADED with classic rock references... try and see if you can guess them all. 
Character: 9/10 - All the main characters that I listed above were all very dynamic and lovable in their own right, but my one and only problem with the characters are the side characters. A lot of times you'll get a very interesting side character who only gets 20 minutes of screen time, and you'll never see him/her... again. However, ALL the main characters are amazing in every way, shape, and form. Spike and Jet are total bad-asses, Faye makes a great seductress for the show (and has a very interesting back story), and Edward is one of the greatest comic reliefs in anime history. Not to mention fucking Vicious, the main antagonist of the show who trained beside Spike. 
Enjoyment: 10/10 - One of the many things that makes Cowboy Bebop so interesting is the fact they are willing to laugh at subjects that most anime wouldn't DARE to touch. Drugs (The Shroom episode... oh god the shroom episode), sex, transvestites, gruesome murders, gambling, and humans who have been heavily experimented on... this anime has 'em all! There is no such thing as limits when it comes to this show, because limits are for pussies! I personally found every single episodes filled with entertainment that had me hooked from start to finish.
This show is not called a classic because it's made in the late 90's, it's called a classic because it fucking deserves the title. If you are looking for a show that steps beyond the boundaries of other anime, and a show where just watching it will cause your chest hair to grow by about 3 inches, than Cowboy Bebop is the show for you!

                “Actually, it’s a very long and dramatic story,” – Jet Black (Episode 23)
	I don’t think there has been a stronger unity between a series and its protagonist than the dramatic 26-episode story of Cowboy Bebop and Spike Spiegel, a series that is exactly like its protagonist and a protagonist that is exactly like its series. For example, Goku was the ideal fit for Dragon Ball Z, a powerful young man known for screaming while in combat and (on a lesser note) for not being there when he’s needed the most; the series is also known for the same two things, the second one being that
                  the series lacks in plot and characterization when it needs it the most. Another example I have is Master Keaton and the titular character of that series, Taichi Keaton. Taichi is a man who should be interesting due to him being a man of many occupations but he comes across as boring just like how the series itself should be interesting due to it being a Naoki Urasawa work but it also comes across as boring. However, I think no protagonist is more suited to a series than Spike Spiegel is to Cowboy Bebop. Spike is a bounty hinter with a past as a former gangster, a native of Mars always hungry for some quick cash. With his wispy dark green Afro and a cigarette in his mouth, Spike journeys from planet to planet in a stylish red fighter plane searching for criminals to apprehend. In the beginning of Cowboy Bebop, Spike was simply a rambunctious young man with dislikes galore and an unceasingly stubborn attitude. Throughout the series, my appreciation for our hard-smoking protagonist grew as Spike became someone who easily flowed between exuding laid-back charm and rugged intensity, as someone who matured to appreciate what he once disliked (kids, dogs, and women with attitude), and as someone who alternated between simple methods and extravagant approaches to solve problems. Actor Steve Blum knows, above all else, how to make a character interesting and Blum was at his all-time best in his role as Bebop’s beloved bounty hunter. Spike Spiegel, the “space cowboy” that the series consistently references, dominated every scene of Cowboy Bebop from the first (a black-and-white shootout) to the last (where Spike spoke one final word, fueling memories of Citizen Kane).
“They are sick and tired of conventional, fixed style jazz,” – Words in Theme Song
Jazz is the definitive sound of Cowboy Bebop, a genre of music closely associated with the word “cool”, and the jazzy songs in Bebop are far from one-dimensional, the songs a passion-filled combination of fast-paced and slow. Bebop’s soundtrack not only contains jazz; there’s also western-themed tracks, hard rock, hypnotic blues, soft rock with English lyrics (extremely rare in anime), and even some bongo beats. At one point, Cowboy Bebop ventures into the classical genre at one point by sampling a famous piece (Tchaikovsky’s “Waltz of the Flowers” in episode 11). The two things I love most about Bebop’s soundtrack are the theme song and the ending theme. “The Real Folk Blues” has the enviable honor of being Bebop’s ending theme, a soulful soft rock song accompanied by a collection of grainy black-and-white images (My favorite part of the ending theme is when the singer says “The re-al FOLK! Blues…” Powerful stuff, man). If you’re reading this review, I know you’ve heard Bebop’s legendary theme song already, an intense, fast-paced jazzy track with a blues guitar in the beginning and a hyperactive horn near the end. Of course, there’s more to Cowboy Bebop than the theme song but man, what a theme song it is!
“Don’t leave things in the fridge,” – Spike Spiegel (Episode 11)
The four main characters don’t merely leave their pasts in the fridge; they allow it to linger until it comes back to bite them. Jet Black is an ex-cop/bounty hunter and the pilot/mechanic of the ship Bebop, a gruff Russian cook with a soft spot. I think actress Wendee Lee delivered a much better performance as Bebop member Faye Valentine, a cigarette-smoking enigma with a gambling addiction, than she ever did as the soft-spoken voice of Azusa Fuyutsuki in Great Teacher Onizuka (Faye’s first scene in Cowboy Bebop is simply unbelievable). As much as I like Spike, Jet, and Faye, my favorite character in the series has to be the one and only Edward Wong Hau Pepulu Tivrusky the Fourth (‘Edward’ or ‘Ed’ for short), a skinny red-headed adolescent girl who specializes in computer hacking, talks in the third person, and injects a unique enthusiasm into every scene she’s in. Throughout the series, a plethora of supporting characters are brought to the fold, from a talking computer program to a homely, rock-loving trucker (The most interesting of these are a trio of elderly Hispanic bickerers that show up in the series again and again). There are also characters in Cowboy Bebop that only appear for one episode but receive more depth than characters in different series earn in a season, like the eccentric cowboy Andy, Mad Pierrot the flying psychopath, Wen the immortal harmonica player (the spiritual predecessor to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood’s Pride), and Elisa, Jet’s former girlfriend. Cowboy Bebop is so phenomenal a series that even characters that don’t amount to much end up being celebrated as classic examples of characterization. Of course, I’m talking about Bebop’s main antagonist Vicious, a white-haired swordsman who never really stood out to me besides having a creepy voice. Other than Vicious, Bebop’s characters are well-acted, complex, and (above all) interesting.
You could argue that Cowboy Bebop isn’t a great series because of its overly episodic plot, the unresolved issues of some of the side stories, and its lack of a legitimately great villain. These are all good points to use in an argument but I’d have two words for you: screw you. Cowboy Bebop is the rare anime series that combines multiple genres into one: mystery, space western, film noir, comedy, blaxploitation, action, philosophical drama, pulp fiction, and even horror (only in episode 20). Every great series has classic scenes but very few series contain scenes as poignant as the ones in Cowboy Bebop; there’s the Cathedral Fall Scene (where images of Spike’s past are revealed with beautifully creepy singing), the Hidden Film Scene (where a younger version of a certain character encourages the viewer in what’s easily the most heartbreaking scene of Bebop), and the Final Fight scene (where Spike finally confronts his past by blowing away his enemies in dramatic fashion), these three scenes distinguishing themselves from the others. Even the episode previews are great, from Spike’s hilarious rant in the episode 6 preview to Jet’s critical review in the episode 18 preview, from Faye’s glorifying speech about love in the episode 15 preview (much to Spike and Jet’s displeasure) to Mad Pierrot’s unforgettable laughing in the episode 20 preview, and (my personal favorite) Edward’s announcement that the series is over during the episode 12 preview. While watching this series, the one thing that confused me the most was the issue of the characters running in motion during the theme song. “Why are they doing this?” I asked myself. Then I figured, “Maybe they too are trying to watch Cowboy Bebop.”",10,bmoore07,

                What can I say about this that hasn't been said before?
This was the show that got me into anime, which looking back at how much time I've lost to it since might not have been such a good thing. There's just something about this, it's easy to feel but hard to pin down. The characters have incredible chemistry, the english dub is one of the best ever recorded, the art style is beautiful and stands up well for it's age, and the soundtrack is probably the strongest I've ever heard. You can tell that the creators had a lot of fun making this because there
                  are so many unique pieces that all fit together in the end product. It's sort of timeless, and I don't think it'll ever stop feeling cool. I keep this show about 5 feet from the DVD player at all times, and this is the first show I recommend to anyone asking me about getting into anime. It's not nostalgia, it's just great. Without a doubt, it was the best of 1998, which had Trigun, Serial Experiments Lain, and Outlaw star all come out then too. If you haven't seen it, but you watch anime, what is wrong with you? This is one of the biggest pillars in anime history, you owe it to yourself to see it.",10,RoneSpeak,

                I gonna be honest with you and I watched all the episodes and it was so unengaging. It must have been one of the best anime of its time but it totally failed to impress me. 
All of the characters (except Jet and Faye) are dull and lifeless especially the stereotypical bounty hunter and gangster spike spiegel. He is a wasted character who tries to be compared to Bruce Lee and Lupin the third and Steve Blum's voice acting makes him sound like a creepy pedophile. 
Enough the animation and music pull's me in it still make's itself a overrated example of corny neo noir
                  and western shows that go really bad over time. Even though I like to respect your opinions, this critic is going full swing on how truly awful this anime is. 
So in my final verdict I give it a 0 out of 5 for being less than mediocre and more tightened up with a hell load cat shit. For all those professional critics and strong fans who it's perfect we'll it's not and nothing is not my own and and not your opinions too. They call it the greatest anime well I call it when you just get of the toilet after having a horrible stomach ache.",4,Perfect8,

                Cowboy Bebop is one of those things that has not aged well. Not because it wasn't a high quality, groundbreaking show that helped to define the genre, but BECAUSE it helped to defined the genre. I'll say now: I didn't grow up with this show. By the time I got around to watching it, I was about 20 and have seen these formulas and characters over and over again. Did Cowboy Bebop do it first? Probably not. Did they do it well? The popularity suggests they did it very very well.
However, over the years people have used this formula so many times that it has
                  fallen into a cliche. To someone watching it (without nostalgia value) everything is predictable and gets painfully boring painfully fast. There wasn't anything shocking in it, nothing I couldn't see happening 5 episodes beforehand, and every character was one I had seen a million times before and wasn't interested in seeing again.
If you're asking me for specifics on what I didn't like, I can't even give that many. It was, for me, a totally forgettable experience.  While I would never deny someone their nostalgia, I'd warn newer viewers to check out something a little more fresh.",6,NeonFraction,
1,"
                I'm going to be quite honest here, most episodic anime, such as Cowboy Bebop really doesn't do a whole lot for me. But it's strange, in all it's 26 episode glory, Cowboy Bebop has managed to do what no other anime has ever done and that is too ensnare me in it's word right from the beginning never failing in letting me go. Cowboy Bebop is, quite simply, my favorite Anime ever. No other anime has shown me such a perfectly balanced world, with such an awe-inspiring atmosphere dripping with originality like Cowboy Bebop has. 
For starters, it's entirely character driven. The show lives and
                  dies by how it manages to get you to connect with its characters. Cowboy Bebop is one of those rare shows that you don't really need to have a favorite character (although we all do, mine is Spike like most people) because you love all the characters so much you being to sympathize and feel connected with every one of them. It's story is also mixed with a perfect marriage between drama and humor. I've seen people call Cowboy Bebop one of the most depressing anime they've ever seen and I've seen other people call Cowboy Bebop the funniest anime they've seen. The reason it can be so funny without intruding on the seriousness of the plot, is due to the fact that unlike most humor in anime, the humor in Cowboy Bebop is deftly subtle. There are really no instances where the show seems immature or chained to conventional anime humor cliches' and I really can't help but appreciate it all the more. You'll laugh, you'll smile, I wanna say you'll cry, but I didn't, your heart strings will definitely be tugged at a time or seven. The thing the series is most notable for, however, is definitely the music. It's more or less a blend of jazz, blues and contemporary rock that almost blends too naturally with the Space Cowboy setting. Each episode has a different musical theme and the Bebop series really gave me the majority of my favorite anime music. 
Listen, I can sit here and talk about how great Cowboy Bebop is all day, but the more I do that, the less time you'll have to sit down and watch it yourself. This is simply one of those anime series that you NEED to watch to call yourself a proper anime fan. I'm not saying you'll love it as much as I do, but if you don't at least give Cowboy Bebop a chance, you're a fool.",10,Spudnspud,

                Cowboy Bebop is a popular high rated anime though many people finds it bad and it is  dropped a lot. Am I surprised of either one of both? Actually not. I am one of the few who is in between of them. So I can understand the arguments of both sides. This is a difficult serie for me to rate. Since the things they have done good are extremely good however for the bad things counts the same. Trying to guide you aswell as me trough my thoughts. Isn’t the most obvious thing to do. But I will give it a try.
So lets begin
                  with the story: It is basically about bounty hunters from the year 2072. These bounty hunters are referred as cowboys a lot in the serie and bebop is the name of their spaceship, if I am not mistaken. So that is where the title comes from. I don’t think there is anything else important to know for now.
The first thing I would like to tell you about the serie is that it is very episodic (If that is even a word). I meant that every episode tells its own story and all those stories gives an idea of their life. I personally don’t like that fact because then you cannot be sucked in the serie as it is supposed to be. That is another reason why I had difficulties to get into the serie and I think that is probably one of the reasons why so many people dropped this anime. On top of that some episodes felt bad and a lot felt like they are fillers. However the good episodes where very good and very amusing to watch. Thats why it is very difficult to criticize the story. Simply because it exist out of 24 different stories. I just don’t like to put a number on the whole bunch and if I would do it on the whole serie it won’t be good either, since it doesn’t has a real plot or something because of this. But I can tell that my rating of these stories goes from 3 to 9 with the higher numbers in the end. Probably cause I started to appreciate the style more. Though the end isn’t built up as good as the other anime series, it is really good and suits the anime perfectly.
I am not really a sci-fi fan, especially things like star wars. This was completely different though. They didn’t put any attention to the future gadgets. I think they did it just for some more spectacular action scenes with those ships. It gave me actually more the feeling that it happened in the past then in the future. especially with those old (beautiful) drawings and the jazz, blues, classic background music. This is all positive in my opinion though. I really like the serie way better as it is.
Guess it is time to go more positive now the worse part of it is done. The best part of the serie for me was without doubt the music. The way they make blues, jazz and classic music exiting is unbelievable! Or is it that what makes the serie exciting? To be honest I don’t know, the only thing I know is that it perfectly suits each other. The way they made the combination let even me enjoy classic music. They really overmastered James Bond with it. Cowboy Bebop just puted Jazz music in the action scenes While James Bond need those good action scenes to get popular. The way they add those weird random sounds at it is really risky. But it is done so great that I love it. The fact that it is so original makes it good. I can understand that a lot of people (especially the younger ones) cannot appreciate that music and surely not in this way. But for me it just made the serie.
The characters are pretty good to. Especially Jet and Spike (the main characters) in my opinion. the other ones aren’t bad but they didn’t got me that much. Probably because The episodes where a new character joins are boring in my opinion. But I must admit that they are all very original. The episodes that goes about Jet and Spike and the way they develop them (slowly but good and full of charm) are very good. That is one of the reasons I absolutely fell in love with those characters. 
However the drawings are old and not that good at first sight, I really started to like them. Spike his look, his hair, his poses, his fights, his cigarettes, … It is all just drawn so beautiful. It may look old but it is still full of charm and emotion. Not only Spike is well drawn but he is just the climax of the drawings in this serie.
So that is why I have double feelings for this wonderful seinen serie.

                Cowboy Bebop is different from other anime in that it does not focus on a linear storyline to progress through the series. It is like a series of short stories that all use the same characters in different scenarios to see how they react when presented with a challenge. However, not all the sessions are disconnected. As we get further into the series, we delve into the past of each character, which gives us a better understanding of how and why each of them act the way they do. This show is more character driven than anything, and because of the memorable characters it provides,
                  Cowboy Bebop is a masterpiece. 
Story/ Pacing - 9/10
I rate the story a 9 although, as I said before, there is not really a linear storyline. Bebop is not your typical anime in that it is episodic. Each ""session"" presents the characters with a different problem, whether it be chasing another bounty or solving a personal issue. These are usually resolved within the same session, save for the pair of two-parters and the many questions about the characters and their backstory. In fact, most of the sessions do not seem to be connected because of the difference in plot. However you soon find this to be untrue as more and more is uncovered about the history of each character. The story does not deserve a perfect score because the show's focus is not on the story, but instead atmosphere and the characters.
Art - 9/10 
Cowboy Bebop is often seen as a classic anime not only because of the reception it received, but its age. Going on 16 years since its release, it has that retro art feel that can be compared to a Miyazaki film. Every scene is filled with incredible detail, and the characters are no exception. Everything in this anime looks beautiful. There is no laziness in the animation itself, which makes everything flow and look natural. 
Sound/Music - 9/10 
This is a difficult portion to judge. The voices many times are quite grainy and echoey, but it is important to remember that this is an older anime and the sound standards have been improved since its debut. In my opinion it doesn't take away from the show or experience whatsoever, but that is up to the viewer to decide. The music is really what makes the sound category worthy of praise. The introduction song, Tank!, gets you excited for the upcoming events with its fast pace beat and memorable ""3, 2, 1, Let's jam"" to get things rolling. The music is placed perfectly alongside events so to help convey the emotions of the characters.
Characters - 10/10
The characters are really what make this anime special. All of them bring a unique personality to the table, making the crew well rounded. These differing personalities do clash, but nonetheless, it is obvious how close the crew gets. All of them have mysterious pasts that are uncovered as you progress through the series. Every question that comes up should be answered by the end (depending on how you view the series conclusion). As I've stated before, the show's primary focus is on the history of each character and their individual desires regarding resolving personal crises. They are truly a memorable cast and are the main reason this show is a classic. 
Enjoyment - 10/10
This section is much less objective than the others because someone can tell you all the contributing factors that make a show good or bad but it is up to the viewer to decide whether or not they actually enjoy it. I found it incredibly easy to enjoy because the pacing is never slow and something interesting is always happening. This is thanks to the episodic nature of the series, which allows almost every session to tell another story. 
Overall - 9/10 
This show is a masterpiece. It's aesthetic value alone makes it a work of art. The Wild West influences and incredible amount of musical references make it appealing to a wide demographic. The use of sessions rather than linked episodes catalyzes a pace and storyline that both make the series very entertaining. The characters are all unique and very easy to get attached to. All these elements came together to create the perfect storm that is Cowboy Bebop. If you have not seen it already, I highly recommend that you take the time to do so. 
See you space cowboy...",9,wasteman,

                There are quite a lot of anime that have a western setting, yet it is rare to see ones that contain the typical ""wild west"" feeling, much less portray in a convincing manner, in which viewers may associate it to adventure and mayhem, rash shootings and cowboys. While this may seem generic, Cowboy Bebop is a character driven story that came as a very pleasant surprise, as it managed to transmit magnificently such theme, with several tweaks to the setting itself. Furthermore, even when it was for the majority of the series of episodic nature, it managed to properly narrate a story with very interesting
                  and varied episodes, whilst fleshing out its cast accordingly; which is difficult and rare in the medium.
~Story~
The story of Cowboy Bebop is centered on the members of the spaceship ""The Bebop"", Spike and Jet, a drifter and retired cyborg cop whose profession is bounty hunting for a living. They meet a lot of odd characters, in which Faye and Ed are one of the main highlights. As mentioned earlier, what is curious is the context of the series: it has its setting in the year 2071 in which humanity has left earth and settled themselves amongst the stars. What is more, it came together with the collapse of nations, and thus the emergence of disorder, violence, freedom and wild shootings -  it has the typical western ""cowboy"" feeling attached to it. It also shares it moments of comedy here and there, which are subtly and well introduced in several occasions without breaking immersion in the story.
This anime is for the major part of the series of episodic nature, yet what is remarkable is the variety within these. Each has its own unique and intriguing story, be it the virus that turn humans into monkeys, the classic parody to the Alien movie, the wacky cowboy, you name it. What further enhances the experience is the fact that each episode provides a feeling of continuity, including great world building showing the viewer how 2071 is, in addition to developing and fleshing its cast accordingly along the way. Some may argue that there are some episodes of lower quality, as it can be hit or miss, yet I found it to be in general of high quality. This doesn't mean the anime doesn't have its share of serious episodes in which actual story progression takes place regarding the characters, in particular that of Spike. These are brimming with life, action and love, giving viewers insight in the characters: it is filled with tension and intrigue. It is worth mentioning that the conclusion of the series is arguably of the most satisfying ones in the anime industry.
~Characters~
Cowboy Bebop is a character driven story, and thus the characters are of great importance to the story to make it work properly, and the anime managed to achieve this masterfully. Although the characters may be considered as stereotypes, in this case it is apparent that these can be very interesting when approached correctly. First of all, it must be mentioned that most of the characters have a mysterious background which is not apparent to viewers at first, yet as story progresses, it is slowly revealed in several bits. Ultimately, most of these are portrayed to audiences in a satisfying manner, yet not fully clarified in some cases, which is left for the viewer to imagine. This may be lacluster for some, but in this case it actually works in its favour to maintain the intrigue and splendid atmosphere of the anime.
The members of the spaceship ""Bebop"" are composed of intriguing and entertaining characters, almost everyone being developed and fleshed out. There is Spike, a calm and cunning, somewhat lazy guy, yet immensely likeable whose motives on staying on the ship are not quite apparent at first, yet with am intriguing past. Then there is Jet, the hard-boiled and hardworking cop, now retired from the profession for bounty hunting instead. Other character of interest is Faye Valentine, a tomboy yet cunning woman, to being at times quite arrogant; but this is all because of her brittle past, which adds to the credibility of her character. Ultimately there is Ed, a superhacker girl, an energetic careless person who acts very childishly; she seems to be there for comical relief, yet it is apparent that she is slowly developed and as well as cunning, albeit in small measures.
Other remarkable aspect of the anime are the interactions with the cast: all of the characters have such diverse personalities that is bizarre to see them all together and interact each other; what ties them together are their common goals, be it revenge, greed, profit, convenience, you name it. The relationships are slowly developed according to their personal development, which was a nice touch to the show. As for the secondary characters and ""villains"" if you may, these are for the majority quite interesting with sometimes motives, or intriguing past that showcase the hardships of society. Some either serve to enhance the comedy, world building, or the story plot itself.
~Animation and sound~
The animation quality of Cowboy Bebop is fantastic, even when considering in aired in the late 90's. The actions scenes, for both combat and space battles, are very fluid giving insight of the whole battle scene to the viewer. In addition, the choreography involved is detailed and feels realistic, further enhancing the experience. As for the art style itself, it is befitting of the atmosphere with very detailed backgrounds; not to mention the great usage of lighting effects to the anime that serves to intone the various atmospheres. The character designs are well done as well, varied and intriguing, matching with the corresponding personalities. However, there were times in which some backgrounds/characters were not as detailed, yet this was a small issue.
Concerning the music score, it is truly outstanding: the use of jazz, blues and classic rock may seem odd considering its setting, yet it fits magnificently with the atmosphere. Each piece is also adjusted to the various situations. The fact that there are 4 CD's with over 80 different pieces composed for the series shows the dedication the studio had for the anime. As for the voice actors, these performed their roles splendidly, matching with the different personalities and intonations used. What came to me as a surprise, is the fact that the english dub was as good (or maybe even better) to the japanese one, which is noteworthy. The openings and endings of the anime were well executed and befitting of the theme, such as Tank!, surely one of the most famous ones.
~Enjoyment~
Cowboy Bebop was overall a great anime, with fantastic characters and their respective development and fleshing out. The soundtracks used in addition to the animation enhanced the viewing experience greatly; the fact that the anime managed to convey an intriguing story despite being of episodic nature was a huge bonus as well. Some viewers may be bothered by this and find them lackluster, as it can be hit/miss for some; the fact that the story is nothing extremely grandiose can be an issue as well, yet at a personal level this was never the case. So do I recommend this anime? I wholeheartedly do to anyone of any demographic, as the characters in conjunction with the animation and sound certainly makes it almost a must watch.

                *In this review I will be switching to a different reviewing system/format.
Cowboy Bebop is often considered one of the greatest anime of all time. I’ve considered watching it for a long time, but I never really got around to it until recently. And now that I’ve finally watched it, I regret not watching the show sooner, not only because it was a good series, but also because I think that if it had been one of the first anime that I watched I would’ve liked it a lot more.
Story:
The story takes place all over the universe in the year 2071. Cowboy Bebop’s story revolves around
                  four main characters, Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine, and Edward. They are all bounty hunters aboard Jet’s ship the Bebop. My main issue with the series as a whole is how the story is told. It’s told in a way that makes every episode seem like a small stand-alone story. The series was too episodic, and there were very few episodes that actually felt connected to each other. That being said, my favorite episodes were the ones that focused on the backgrounds of the characters, even though an overall plot really didn’t connect all of them. I just wished that Cowboy Bebop had a more focused narrative.
Animation:
I’d heard nothing but good things about the animation in Cowboy Bebop; but, since it came out in 1998, I wasn’t sure how much I would like it. I’m glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the animation. There were times where I thought, “Wow, this was made in 1998?” But there were other times where I thought, “Yeah, this was made in 1998.” Overall, the animation is solid throughout the entire series.
Sound:
The sound in Cowboy Bebop is one of the best parts of this series. The whole sound track has a soulful and jazzy vibe. The only issue I have with the sound is that the only songs that you hear multiple times are the songs of the opening and ending. This isn’t really a bad thing. The opening and ending are both really good, but there are just so many good songs you hear throughout the series that I wish that they would’ve used more often. Most of the songs are episode specific, so the music definitely fits the overall themes and tones of the episode, but you’ll probably never hear those songs again throughout the entire series.
Characters:
The characters are the most interesting part of this series. They all and have totally different personalities, and reasons for becoming bounty hunters. All of them have a mysterious past, which they are either not willing to talk about or just don’t remember. As I said earlier, my favorite episodes in the series are the ones that focus on the backgrounds of the characters. This is partially because these episodes feel the most connected in terms of an overarching narrative, and also partially because I found those episodes the most entertaining. Spike’s background episodes in particular had the some of, if not, the best action scenes in the entire series. There are also several supporting and side characters in the series, but you usually won’t see them in more than one episode. This is fine because during that one episode that they are in their entire story or reason for being there is explained pretty well.
Enjoyment:
Like I said earlier, I think that if this had been one of the first anime that I’d ever watched I would’ve liked this series a lot more than I do. Don’t get me wrong, Cowboy Bebop is an entertaining series, but it has a very episodic format that took away some of the enjoyment for me.
Verdict & Breakdown:
Story: 3.4/5
Animation: 3.5/5
Sound: 4/5
Characters: 4/5
Enjoyment: 3.5/5
Verdict: 3.7/5
Even though I don’t think this series is a masterpiece, Cowboy Bebop is a classic anime that is definitely worth checking out.

                Spike Spiegel is a bounty hunter with a dark, violent past. Nowadays, he roams between the seedier colonies of space along with his partner Jet Black and their spaceship Bebop as they try to catch a bounty or two, barely making a living at it. Some of their bounties, like the mysterious Faye Valentine and the intelligent 'data dog', Ein, end up as fellow partners. Is Spike trying to justify prior misdeeds by working for the right side of the law? What will happen when his past catches up to him? And what of the pasts of his fellow shipmates? Will any of them survive
                  long enough to find out? 
Cowboy Bebop has been often referred to as the new anime noir, a title that does fit, but doesn't even begin to fully describe it. Equal parts film noir, spaghetti western, and 70's cop show; Cowboy Bebop is both retro and fresh at the same time. A very stylish, beautifully crafted series that deserves much more attention than it gets. If ever there was a series more deserving to be a sleeper hit, Bebop is it.
Cowboy Bebop is well suited to TV. Each episode manages to stand alone, but at the same time link together an overall larger story. Even if you only see two or three episodes, not exactly in order, one wouldn't be lost, and would find enjoyment in them. In order to truly appreciate it, though, one must see it through.
Cowboy Bebop also presents a realistic view of the future. Spike and Jet travel in what to us would be a highly sophisticated craft, but to them is the modern day equivalent of a 1976 El Camino. The places they visit are far from what one would expect. Instead of Neo-Tokyo with its shiny, impossibly tall skyscrapers that never end, we have Neo-Tijuana, with its dusty dirt roads, run down shacks and migrant workers. Space is ethnic, but not in the Star Trek sanitized for the sake of politically correctness way. Each colony reflects a melting pot more akin to Los Angeles or New York City than any Blade Runner wannabe ever could.
This striving for realism also is reflected in the character designs. Spike is lanky and handsome in his own way, but by no means is he a slender pretty boy. Faye is sexy and curvy, but she's no large breasted bimbo. Jet is burly, not fat, and has traits that would make one think he is of Russian descent. Ein can easily be recognized as a Welsh corgi, and not just another undistinguishable mutt. The only one who looks remotely like a 'cartoony' character is Ed, and even then no one would ever mistake her as anything -but- a scrawny preteen tomboy. (And to see her name and appearance, you'd think she just got off the boat from the Philippines.)
The animation is beyond superb. Its quality excels over most current releases. Cowboy Bebop uses computer graphics, but does so in such a fluid, breathtaking manner. There are practically no scenes that feel 'artificial', like what's going on in the foreground is totally separate from the background. Many computer-generated anime can't seem to shake the look that the characters are just floating in front of the background stills. Everything in Cowboy Bebop seems to breathe with life and motion, even in otherwise stoic scenes, and it's a rarity and a marvel to behold.
Another bonus Cowboy Bebop has going for it is the soundtrack. Yoko Kanno scores (literally) again with her work for this series. The opening theme alone is already one of *the* best intro pieces I have ever heard. The blend of jazz and blues is absolutely perfect in setting the mood of the series. I ask you, has this woman ever -done- any bad music? (Of course not!)
Then there's the storyline. Even though each episode stands quite well on its own, with poignant moments interspersed with exciting action, the underlying theme of Spike Spiegel and his motivations for what he does is absolutely intriguing. With each flashback, you get one more piece of the puzzle, from Spike's shady origins to the loves that influenced the way he is. Maybe his bounty hunting is really a search for identity as much as a way of life he has chosen. The plot and characterization in Cowboy Bebop have a sophistication and subtlety that is practically one-of-a-kind. It's hard to find movies this involving, much less animated television series. Cowboy Bebop simply puts most anime...and Hollywood, to shame.
On the surface, it's easy to dismiss as '70s retro fluff. ""Hey, there's Vega$ all over again!"" And yes, many a Japanese and American movie star or feature is lampooned in one form or another during each episode. Cases in point: Spike Spiegel is a postmodern Lupin III. And in the first episode alone, Asimov Sorenson and Katarina.... can we say Desperado, kids? (Heck, even Quentin Tarantino seems to have a cameo!) But beneath that noir veneer is a very human drama that has just enough humor and clever dialogue to be realistic, yet highly entertaining. This is a must-have for any serious collector of Japanese animation.
Simply put, this anime is one of the best.",10,takakara_nomuro,

Cowboy Bebop was one of the first few anime that I properly sat down and watched. After the horrible atrocity that was Fate/Zero I asked my friend to give me something ""a little different"", perhaps a little more ""western"" in its storytelling. Mainly because I had some pretty ignorant assumptions on cultural storytelling back then. 
Well, he was nice enough to give me Cowboy Bebop. A show he described as, ""the most western anime ever."" Cool. I sat down and watched it in about a week. 
I left with a few mixed feelings, but overall, it was a positive experience that I think many anime
                  fans rightfully call a ""classic"" in the medium. Much like the show, i'll break up this review into small digestible chunks. 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
PART 1 : The Purpose of a Genre 
Television works in funny ways. Well, not really funny as much as generic, obvious, and pandering. Even in Japan, where the entire culture is different than America's, the way television (and film) is created is still similar. The demographic of the script is determined, the show/film gets its director and production company, it gets funded, and the shooting begins. That's one of the many ways something can get started.
The key term here is demographic. Everything is made for an audience, and that audience is everything for what's being made. Put simply, if no one is watching and buying; then your product is caput. The way you make sure that at least someone will watch and buy is by determining something called a demographic. Which pretty much means the sex and age range of an audience. 
For example, a show like Sword Art Online is made with the 13-17 male demographic, however, it has reaches into the 18-27 male demographic as well. The show is adapted from the manga(or is it a LN i'm not sure) with the same key demographic. So a bunch of people come together and talk about what people in that age like. 
Titties : Check
Loud anime yelling : Check
Self-insert wish fulfillment : Check 
Flashy animation when fighting actually happens : Check
...
With these concepts they created the most generic and marketable show possible. Their show is the literal equivalent of oatmeal with nothing on it. Something that's easily edible. 
But the point is that these people created this show with this audience in mind. This means that the show excels (hopefully) at these certain things. If you need fan service to appeal to a bunch of horny teenage boys, then you try your best to make it be some really damn good fan service! If you need loud moralistic anime protagonist, you better get the most generic possible self-insert wish-fulfilling protagonist you can! 
So while this show may suck massive meat-wagons its still a show that excels at those things. 
...
This leads me to Cowboy Bebop. A show that doesn't really excel at anything. A show that doesn't really fit in a base genre. Sure people sometimes call it a ""space opera"" but that's a horribly defined genre, in my opinion. It pretty much encapsulates every possible base genre. It has comedy, horror, drama, action, and mystery. 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
PART 2 : Lack of a Flavor is More of a Flavor
So what exactly does ""it just kinda does everything pretty good"", mean? Well for one it means that I came out of the show thoroughly...fine. Nothing really stood out as mind-blowing or even great, but everything flowed decently well that I never really found the show to be a slog to sit through. The entire thing felt so harmless. 
Its attempts at emotion were fine, its action was generally pretty good, the detours into more experimental one-off episodes was fairly pleasing as well. It had a decently designed cast with a cute little dog cause signature pets are cool to have. It had a story that flowed well, although wasn't given enough time to actually become something special. It followed an episodic structure that felt good to watch but ultimately didn't add much to the show... more on that later. 
With this lack of focused genre, it really felt like the show was just middle-of-the-pack on everything. Which is why I can't really bring myself to criticize all too much. It quite literally does almost everything well enough that I don't have much to say on it. 
Our titular protagonist is a charming semi-douche that is ultimately more like-able and interesting than most anime protagonists. His companions are all fairly engaging too. Faye has a great character design, Jet has a nice presence, Edward is ultimately the comedic relief and so on. 
Point is, the show is just good. Throughout all the episodes, which play out very episodically, I found myself not having any disdain towards any of them. Sure most of them weren't all too memorable... the standouts being one with mushrooms, one with a fridge, and one with a fat man floating around like a balloon. But overall, they had some decent sci-fi storylines with decent execution. 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
PART 3 : Story Without Story 
So the one thing that bugged me about the show was its execution of the main storyline. While its episodic by nature, every half-way point we have a story-driven episode that revolves around our protagonist, Spike. I won't spoil what its about but it involves love and heartbreak, duh. 
So with these story-driven episodes, the show shifts from meandering fourth gear to a full-out lore-mode fifth gear. The switch doesn't often feel natural, but the episodes themselves are all generally pretty good. 
However, the biggest issue is that the writers don't give these stories enough time. I can think of a handful of disconnected episodes that could've been cut in favor of creating a more interesting and believable story. 
Since this whole story-arc literally takes only five episodes to resolve, the other twenty one episodes are just kind of there. Five episodes is hardly enough time to create any believable characters or engaging interactions that lead to a very bombastic conclusion in a way that feels emotionally powerful.
Specifically, Spike's love from his past, Julia, gets a truly pitiful amount of development. This creates scenes that are meant to be emotional into yet another ""ok"" scene. It doesn't feel bad as much as it just feels ""ok"". 
But the reason I feel like i can't give a show a pass for this is because they played this entire thing out like it was supposed to be something bigger. A big arc. But they didn't give it enough time. Why do an episodic series of twenty six episodes and only give the story five? Especially if you only want one season? It felt like a nonsensical idea to me. 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
Conclusion : 
Honestly, this review seems harsher than it needs to be. Saying the show is ""mediocre"" would mean its a 5.0/10. Its not mediocre. Its definitely above average, and the character interaction, for the most part, is good enough to elevate the show. 
It has some very well choreographed fight sequences and some very genuine moments. Its overall a very pleasant show to watch. For me, it isn't the untouchable classic that many may call it, its still a good time that i'd recommend to any fan of television. 
It may have not thought out its base storyline enough to make it something special, but some of the standout episodic episodes do more than enough to create a smooth and memorable experience.

                In my mind, Cowboy Bebop is the perfect show for people you know who say ""Anime? What are you, 12?"" 
It's slick, it's funny, it's serious, and it knows how to avoid anime stereotypes. It has characters that you'll never get tired of, plot twists that will keep you watching up late at night, epic fight scenes, and a soundtrack that is worth shelling out for.
With that said, let's roll.
Story: 9
Though it wanders on occasion, I'd like to say that nearly 100% of the time it's to develop characters further or to add a bit of humor. The Star Trek parody episode was a bit
                  over the top (but enjoyable), and to me it's hard to enjoy enjoy the filler episodes as much as the ones where sh*t really gets real. But let's delve into those. WOW. The last two episodes of the show are as good as it gets in anime. Not to mention the 5th episode, or the back-to-back ones that take place on Mars. I won't ruin any story elements, but look forward to these. If you take anything from this review, take this: those 5 episodes are worth watching over, and over, and over, for any anime fan.
Art: 8
It's tough to write a review now for a show that took place as long ago as it did, but I'll give it a shot. It's well drawn, and well animated, but it's nothing mindblowing. I remember seeing the first episode fight scenes and being thoroughly impressed, but for me the main draws of the show were always the music, the characters, and the story. I can't say I've ever been much of an art critic, but for the most part is was aesthetically pleasing. I was certainly impressed by the character design, and the world that the artists created was both interesting and desirable. 
Sound: 10
Yoko Kanno honestly outdid herself this time. In all my years of watching anime, this is the first time I've really felt like I NEEDED the soundtrack. Great OP, great songs throughout, great everything. So impressed with what she did here.
Character: 9 
How can you not love Spike Spiegel or Faye Valentine? They're the ones that you'd like to be in real life. To me, it's not just how badass the characters are, it's the ideals they represent. Honor, bravery, and an unwillingness to let anything stand before something that you know in your heart is right. The only comparison that I can make here is a show called Firefly, which isn't an anime but in some ways reminds me of Bebop. Great design, great execution, and I wouldn't get sick of any of them even if the show went on for 100 eps.",9,Qvothe,

                The almighty and legendary Cowboy Bebop. Well, here goes my best shot. 
Story: 7,5
At first to me it seemed like Cowboy Bebop will be an episodic anime, which ones are usually plain bad and become boring after a few episodes. But Cowboy Bebop is a proof that anime mustn't evolve a single plot straight only to conclusion. Truth be said most of the Cowboy Bebop episodes are fillers, but not to the bad meaning of the fillers that you usually see in Naruto or Bleach or any other anime.
In Cowboy Bebop these episodes are more like expansions off the characters and mini stories with
                  their own thoughts and meaning. Almost all of the episodes have some points to make and are relevant to the characters. They allow you to get more attached to characters. Sometimes you get small flashbacks in some episodes and they improve your understanding of how human and realistic these characters are.
As for the plot relevant episodes I would really have wanted more of them, because they seemed to answer a lot of questions, but not enough to satisfy my curiosity. I really would want to know more about Spikes past. And the ending even though very cool and memorable for me seemed a bit dissapointing. Also if you think about it the main story is kinda cliche if not for the ending.
Visuals: 9,25
The visuals are more then you should ask for. Cowboy Bebop was made in 1998 and truth be it has put to shame other anime since 1998 to even now as for the visuals. The best I liked about it was how detailed it was, all the characters are easy to distinguish and backgrounds are very beautiful too. Backgrounds change a lot of times as the Bebop crew goes from different planets starting to mostly deserted planets to snowy cold planets. 
As for the animation it is very smooth and fluid, the action is very well choreographed and only once I saw repeated movement and I think it was done on purpose to make Ed look silly, not because the animators were lazy.
Sound: 10
Everything about sound is just WOW and awesome to the extreme. The opening is great and I didn't skip it once for all 26 episodes.
As for the background music there is a lot of it and even though it mostly consists of jazz, bebop and bluze it also had one episode with heavy metal and some other music too. The background music usually surprised me of how good it was all out through the series. That background music just made every major moment in this anime just so much more memorable and enjoyable.That's what you get from Yoko Kanno.
I personally only have seen the dub, but from what I heard it is one of the best, if not the best dubs out there . I think that Steve Blumes role as Spike Spiegel is his best.
Characters: 8 
It's not like you really get a lot of time spent on building up the characters, but somehow on the way you pick up pieces about Spike, Faye, Jet and Ed. As the series progresses you get some parts of there back-stories, but you don't get all of it. Well at least I thought that there could of been more back-stories for them. But I have to admit that it helped for extra realism that you don't know all about these characters from the start even to the end there are a lot mystery around them.
As for other characters they show up and disappear very soon except Vicous the villain ( his name sounds like a villain already)  who I didn't like, because a real villain needs to have a fucking good reason to be a villain, but all I got from him is that he has bad past with Spike, which really doesn't explain a lot, because we don't know much about Spikes past except for few flashbacks.
Enjoyment: 9
I enjoyed this anime a lot. Never did I get bored watching it and most of the time I was stuck to screen sitting on the edge of my seat. But I have to say that once the episode was done I wasn't that reluctant to go watch the next episode, because there wasn't an overarching plot that would connect from one episode to the next.
Overall: 9
The best part about Cowboy Bebop was the music and animation. The production value for this anime was very high even for nowadays standards. I have to say that I didn't like the story that much because I found it cliche a bit and the characters even though cool and pretty much realistic they didn't really relate to me. But also I must admit that this anime has something that you really can't categorize and that is style. And that style just makes all those bad things I said about it almost meaningless.
I would recommend this anime to every anime fan and even to people that haven't seen any anime, because it has a lot of good qualities that could interest non-anime people into watching it. As for those people who care more about the stories morals and what it has to tell you about everything I would not advise you to jump in watching this anime with high expectations, because Cowboy Bebop is more about style over matter.",9,reinis-jan,

                Cowboy Bebop is a whole collection of classic genres, all mixed into one series and all done right, to the point that it breathes new life into a very stale genre. If ever there was a series more deserving to be a sleeper hit, Bebop is it.
Many times have I visited Cowboy Bebop, and every time we've parted company I leave with a sense of how great a conversationalist Cowboy Bebop truly is. How it tells beautiful stories with nothing but ink, paint, computers, and sound. How it seems to transcend it's own media and become something unto itself. Nothing to be worshiped or canonized,
                  but to be viewed with a measure of respect, and perhaps awe, that such a thing ever took place at all.
Cowboy Bebop, that's the story. There are cowboys and there is bebop, set against the backdrop of the future and space. The series concerns itself with the lives of Jet Black, Spike Spiegal, Faye Valentine, and Ed. The series itself tends to revolve around sorting out each characters past and reconciling it with their present selves. What sets Cowboy Bebop apart from similar series such as Outlaw Star is that these stories are actually interesting.
The places they visit are far from what one would expect. Instead of Neo-Tokyo with its shiny, impossibly tall skyscrapers that never end, we have Neo-Tijuana, with its dusty dirt roads, run down shacks and migrant workers. Space is ethnic, but not in the Star Trek sanitized for the sake of politically correctness way. Each colony reflects a melting pot more akin to Los Angeles or New York City than any Blade Runner wannabe ever could.
Characters from Cowboy Bebop each have stories to tell. Each deals with its past and present as best they can, although often times not very well at all. The plot is linear as far as the time line is concerned, but there isn't a penultimate goal sought after. In terms of the classic definitions of conflict, Cowboy Bebop tends towards the man versus himself, or man versus man types of conflict. The principles of Cowboy Bebop do not seek paradigm shifts, do not seek to change the world for the better or worse, but simply to live to see another day. This struggle to live on is what makes Cowboy Bebop so enjoyable, and what gives a humanity to the principle characters that they would otherwise lack.
Animation directors strive for different goals. Some, like Hayou Miyazaki seek a balance between we humans and nature. The director of Ghost in the Shell, Mamoru Oshii forewarned us that advancement without restraint presented dillemas with no solutions. Shincihiro Wantanbe gave us, with Cowboy Bebop, twenty-six pictures of a world coming to terms with its past. The methods vary, with death, resignation, and an eyes wide shut attitude dominating. 
But never are these heady themes forced upon us with a heavy hand. They are at many times hidden behind sharp humor, attention to detail, and jaw dropping animation. Only two times are these themes truly brought to a head: at the twelfth and thirteenth episodes (parts one and two of Jupiter Jazz), and episodes twenty-five and twenty-six (parts one and two of The Real Folk Blues). And at these moments the music gets better, the animation sharper, and like true climactic moments, they stay with us long after we finish watching them. Everything in Cowboy Bebop seems to breathe with life and motion, even in otherwise stoic scenes, and it's a rarity and a marvel to behold.
Never before or since has such a catalog of music been assembled for an anime, any anime. The principle creator of Cowboy Bebop's music, Yoko Kanno, took the high-road. She hopped from genre to genre in leaps and bounds while never taking from the animation itself, but infusing it with a pulse that at all times seemed perfect. Sometimes characters are defined through music, like Gren, whose sax playing pronounces him melancholy, disillusioned, and cavalier. Three original soundtracks were put together for this anime, each one is distinct and non-repetitious. Listening to them on their own gives you new appreciation on the quality of Yoko Kannos gift.
The concept of Cowboy Bebop is not original, but its execution is outstanding. The characters are not original, but how they interact with the world around them is. The music can be defined by genre, but the impact on the individual cannot. The animation has been topped over the years, the cgi definitely shows its age, but there are still moments of raw beauty that are still unparalleled. Cowboy Bebop is not a rite of passage in anime fandom, but it should be a signpost, showing you the difference between the sublime and the ordinary.",9,PirateKingz,

                Frankly, I'm not sure how I can do a show like Cowboy Bebop justice in reviewing it in such tiny space. I think Cowboy Bebop is absolutely a product of genius. I think genius minds conceived and executed the concepts, story, and production of this series, and I believe it will always mean a great deal to me. I say this with the utmost concern for nostalgia and trying to disappate it, judging the show by its merits and not for the time at which I watched it and how radical it was at the time, but rather for what it continues to be based
                  on its true merits. 
For one, I can see why others may dislike elements of the show, but those are the same elements I think are justified. The show is episodic, yes, but rather than being a bunch of completely unrelated adventures that just feature the core cast in different situations, the episodes are more like a series of short little films that each reveal a little more of the bigger picture, not necessarily of the main underlying plot, but something much more important, which is the world and atmosphere, the environment and attitudes which are pervasive in the show. The very lives of the characters are ""episodic"", but an episode rarely ends without having made some headway in unveiling more of the tapestry of this world the characters live in. 
The main plot, the plot of Spike's past with the Red Dragon, that's something that keeps together the threads, but ultimately only exemplifies- well, perhaps more than that, epitomizes- the grander attitude of the entire work. Given more time to breath, perhaps a more traditionally strong narrative would  have worked its way out, which is probably the only flaw I can find with this show. However, it's barely a flaw, because it serves as a great and tragic sword of Damocles over the throne of the viewer. However, unlike that sword, it does certainly strike, and surely, and with consequence. 
The production values are quite breathtaking, some still by today's standards. The music is especially spellbinding. The show is very stylish, and so more cynical folks may be lured into believing the show is ""style over substance"", but the style becomes part of its substance, much in the way a Tarintino film both indulges in and skewers pop art culture. 
It's a show that feels almost as new every new time I watch as it did the first time. Sure, now I've been exposed to several anime that closely rival its greatness. But none of them quite manage to match or surpass it. 
Cowboy Bebop is a stellar series. Perhaps the most representative of what anime can accomplish, It is both entertaining and provocative. It's a rousing jazzy ballad of the bizarre and the sorrowful. It's a must see for anyone.",10,penguintruth,

                This was the first anime I ever watched that made me completely re-evaluate what was possible in an animated medium. Not only that but despite the improvements in computers and technology that have allowed anime to become more visually astouding, cowboy bebop managed to achieve the same levels of detail and motion of modern anime over a decade ago.
Do not approach cowboy bebop as being anime. It is animated, but really it is more like live action then a cartoon. The creators of this show did not skimp when it came to fully animating fight scenes, space battles, or even some of the more idle
                  moments. There is never a moment where footage is recycled or cheesy backgrounds go flying by while characters strike a pose, nor are there any chibi or emoted moments.
Cowboy Bebop is also best if not rushed through, there IS an overall story arc, but most of the episodes are self contained, and do not really require rapid succession. Also when you complete this anime you will surely feel that the show is concluded, and that a sequel or serialization of the series is unnecessary. This show is good enough to re-watch and still find the same enjoyment as the first time you saw it.
Usually its difficult to fully decide how to rank anime since there are many ways to do it, such as by overall plot (i HATE cop-out endings which are typical of most shows.. curse you school rumble!), quality of art/animation/ visual excellence, music, voice talent, dub (if applicable), characters/character development, and something that is sometimes neglected is depth (how much do you have to allready know to fully enjoy an anime). However, Cowboy Bebop excels in every one of these areas, so it makes it easy for me to give this show 10's across the board, it truly is a masterpiece, and is not as difficult as EVA to fully appreciate, as it does not require you to wikipedia info on Jewish Mythology, Kabalism, Sephiroths, ect. and can be watched in English without sacrificing any aspect of the show, which also makes this show a great candidate for newbies to serious (non serialized) anime.
ON A SPECIAL NOTE:
Yoko Kanno is quite possibly one of the greatest film composers, and wrote a ludicrous amount of FULL LENGTH music for this show. If the quality of the anime isn't enough to get your rocks off there are about 8 cd's worth of top notch music, (mostly jazz, blues, and gospel) all origional work composed for this series which I also recommend to you audiophiles. The Seatbelts are awesome...",10,dreiak,

                Since being a critic means writing tons of words, people often think of us as pretentious assholes who can’t have fun. Some critics swallow that crap and then write meaningless bullcrap instead of admitting they enjoyed a stylish, flashy story. The easiest way to recognize it is when a series is said to be about ‘existentialism’. That’s so general, but so useful. After all, that stream of philosophy is huge and you can insert anything into it.
Since I don’t care about my image, I’m not going to claim Cowboy Bebop is about ‘existentialism’ when I can’t back it up. I have no shame in admitting
                  I love a story that’s all about flash, action and amusing characters. That’s what Cowboy Bebop is and it’s proof that mere storytelling is an art too. There are a few touching moments and the last episodes push for something more profound, but until then there isn’t any depth. Why should it have any when “Mushroom Samba” is one of the best anime episodes ever?
Watanabe taglined the show as “a new genre unto itself” and later called it an exaggeration. That’s like the fastest runner in the world saying he’s slow. Cowboy Bebop never runs out of steam or ideas. It always has a wide-eyed sense of wonder and always excited what other stories it can tell. Many of the tropes are recognizable, but nothing is a missed chance.
The approach is akin to a band that tries a new genre with every song. People who complain about the episodic nature miss the point. The series has a wider reach than nearly every anime out there. Pretty much every episode is a whole different genre. The characters and art style are the same, but even the color schemes change. “Mushroom Samba” and “Cowboy Funk” are experiments with Comedy and have brighter colors. “Toys in the Attic” experiments with horror and is noticeably darker.
Even pacing and side-character design changes. The aforementioned “Mushroom Samba” has far wackier character design than “Speak Like a Child”, one of the more introspective episodes. The series doesn’t simply borrow a lot from Western fiction but distills it to one show. It had mass appeal because it had a wide reach – whoever you are, there’s something to like her.
Convincing the viewer that the world in your anime exists is difficult. Calling things ‘realistic’ or ‘unrealistic’ isn’t enough, since you first have to know what reality is (or, more correctly, how people perceive reality). The solid blocks don’t define reality. Spaceships and cities on the moon aren’t automatically ‘unrealistic’. If you told people from 1000 years ago that anime will exist they’ll think you’re possessed by a devil.
Reality and real life go deeper than this. Reality is, among things, confusing and has a lot of sides. If it didn’t we wouldn’t need to create art. The most realistic anime are the most far-reaching ones. An anime is more realistic the more it can contain different moods and different people. It doesn’t matter whether you live as a drifter or in a small community – life has all kinds of things going for it.
The show has bounty hunters in space, loud gunfights and a failed experiment that learned to fly. It’s still more realistic – and thus more alive than most anime out there. The variety in mood and texture of the events brings it to life. I couldn’t imagine a show having a fat balloon assassin feeling realistic.
The cast is also a prime example of how to have an ensemble. Spike isn’t the main character. They’re all are. Their personalities aren’t simply different but connected, there is chemistry here. Jet isn’t just a contrast to Spike’s apathy, but a more warm figure for the damaged Faye and the young Ed. Spike’s apathy and cockiness is what puts him at odds with Faye but their greed is what they share and what unites them. Ed herself is a sun in the group of depressed individuals. The characters don’t act out of convenience but on their inner drives, and each of their reactions is uniquely theirs.
Variety itself isn’t enough, of course. You need more than the basics of having different episodes with different styles and moods. The narratives are always tightly focused. The world is full of great anime, but few deserve the award of ‘no useless shots’. Except for the plot-heavy episodes (which don’t really work anyway), every shot equals progress.
It’s worth noting that Cowboy Bebop isn’t a dialogue-heavy show. It borrowed this from the film noire genre. Unlike noire’s bad side, Bebop doesn’t rely on dark shots to let you things are dark. Rather, it doesn’t use a lot of dialogue because it doesn’t need to. The shots are informative enough, and so are never boring.
The series’ only flaw is the grand story behind it focusing on Spike’s past. The series doesn’t exactly lose focus, but confidence. Up until then the defining trait was elegance. Everything was small, but it was enough that counted for a lot. Suddenly we have this huge backstory of broken hearts and smoking guns and overthrowing a criminal syndicate. The last two episodes, while having decent actions, end up mostly as a collection of serious dialogue and dark staring. It survives only on the show’s natural charm. This is one route that demanded a whole new way of storytelling. It’s nice of Watanabe to try but it didn’t work.
Cowboy Bebop is a great anime not because it’s philosophical, influential or borrows a lot from Western fiction. It’s brilliant because it’s a masterpiece of pure storytelling. There are no useless parts in these 23 or so episodes. Each story is different both in events, pacing and mood. People who are uncomfortable with this will make stuff up about ‘existentialism’ but it’s their loss. Regardless of who you are, there’s something to enjoy here.

                You've got be in a certain time at a certain place to appreciate Cowboy Bepop. It's sense of cultural mismatch doesn't excuse it's lack of identity. It pushes style over substance because there is no substance. It's constant homage to everything and anything muddies whatever originality it has.
But at the same time, cowboys in space sounds cool right? Freeform jazz is cool too. Martial arts are cool. Are these the reasons the anime became so famous? Or is it because the 90s meant it had to be viewed on television at whatever time the channels chose to air Japanese cartoons, meaning that the sense of
                  disconnect was covered up by genuine disconnection? Is it because it was the only good looking anime that could be watched - in English - without cringing?
Perhaps it's my fault I didn't like Cowboy Bepop. Maybe it's because I chose to marathon it, going 3-4 episodes a day? Maybe it's because it's old? Maybe I'm simply not the target audience? During the duration I gave Cowboy Bebop, I was constantly trying to puzzle together why I didn't like it. Maybe it'll get better, I figured.
The thing is that any logical conclusion I could think of didn't make sense. Other 90s anime include some of my all time favourites like Neon Genesis, Revolutionary Girl Utena and Serial Experiments Lain, so it's definitely not my lack of tolerance towards it's age. I've marathoned tons of shows, and if anything, that tends to make me enjoy them more. I love sci-fi.
When I finally came to my senses, I finally rejected the idea that Cowboy Bepop is good. I accepted my own opinion, piercing through the thick armour of everybody else's, fuelled by rampant nostalgia and shielded by being overly sympathetic to the show's age.
With most (x)-of-the-week shows, you figure out quite quickly whether you'll like them or not based on 1 or 2 episodes. I liked Bepop at first, I loved it's sense of style, with a Blade-Runner-like noir universe and fun jazz. But every episode had exactly the same format, with no connections between episode - no hook to make me care. The 20 minute runtime of the show meant that they nose-dived into introducing whoever they chase, they chase them and then they get paid. The action sequences were so drawn out that there wasn't any time for fickle character development or an underlying plot. 
Every single list discussing the best characters in anime includes one or two of these characters. After 16 or so mundane episodes, I just couldn't figure this one out. They're bland. Their interactions are cold and sterile with little chemistry. A sense of family was forced upon you, but it only served to remind how stereotypical and cliche Jet's caring side is. Faye's design makes her nothing more than sci-fi modified fanservice, and her character has very little going on inside. Ed is annoying.
And then we come to Spike, who serves as the show's hero. He's a generic Marty Stu, who's too cool to care about. 
Cowboy Bepop amazes me, it really does. The aura of perfection is has, built solely on fond memories of small TVs and awkward schedules, is impressive. But if you take it out of context, the facade falls down. Cowboy Bepop is weekly trash and nothing more.",3,SpaceWhales,

The storyline is great.
If you want to know if you're going to like Cowboy Bebop, I suggest to watch the first 4 episodes, they are a small introducing to the rest to the series. 
The story is about a space cowboy named spike, he is a bounty hunter on the ship the bebop. Together with Faye and Jet he collects bounty's, this isn't going that well all the time, therefore Cowboy bebop has a lot of humor, unlike most anime. 
The episodes selves are all different stories in one storyline, that's what makes Cowboy bebop unique. Every episode has got a lot of action
                  in it, so it'll never bore you! It's really different from the other anime, but it's still good. 
All characters in the Bebop has his own backstory, which all get's unraveled during the series. 
I really enjoyed watching this serie and I highly suggest you to watch it. 
It has everything, again! Action, a bit romance, depression, humor and even horror (it's my opionon of horror ;))

                Story: 8/10
A Series that was made in the late 90s and looking at that time where the anime was made, it had a quite interesting and nice story. The anime haves the old style of airing episodes, where almost every episode is for itself, just like in marvel shows.
Every single episode was really great in its own way. Some are really funny, some are sad and some are just epic and interesting. The cowboy + space combination was really great if you ask me. I totally enjoyed the story and was really sad because there wasn't more and not everything was explained. That is actually
                  the only reason why i give it a 8 out of 10.
Characters 9/10
Characters in this anime are really great, not because they are ""cool"" or something. I'm talking about the different kinds of characters they made, and all of them special on their own and all them together make the perfect combination. The balance between funny/cool/sad and and and was perfect. I only wish i could learn more about every character, cause their individual story and past is such touching.
Music: 10/10
Giving it a 10 because i'm a huge Jazz/Blues/Metal fan and this anime had all of it. I was thinking that such music couldn't fit that great with anime, but it really can, and this anime is the proof for it.
Animation: 9/10
It was made in the 90's and for that, it had animations that are really nice made, from the movement of the characters to the fighting scenes and the surroundings, the space and the nature...it was all really nice to see and watch.
I respect them for making it with such quality even back then.",9,GenesisCore93,

                The nonchalant Spike, The righteous Jet, The sneaky Faye, and witty Edward....
These beloved characters have in-printed themselves onto my heart slowly but surely.
CowBoy Bebop is an anime that was recommended to me by various sources. Knowing that the anime was about 14 years old, I was hesitant to start it up. Eventually, with the consistent nagging of my buddies and fellow anime fan, I started Cowboy Bebop.
Took me three days to marathon it, and boy what a ride it was!!
Story:
There only has been a few animes that were in a “episodic” style that I really enjoyed. Mushi shi was one, xxxholic was another, and I
                  guess we can count Tsubasa chronicles as another. Besides those cherished anime, I have been left unimpressed by that style of storytelling. Little did I know that cowboy Bebop was the revolutionary anime that introduced this style to the animation world. Not only did it introduced, but it was executed perfectly most of the time.
There were episodes that I could have done without, some of the earlier episodes to be specific, and few random episodes in the mid section of the anime. This is not a problem since most the episodes were great and done a very aesthetically pleasing manner. 
The story in these episodes were less about plot and more about characters. These mini stories helped us understand and get to know the main characters in a unique manner. Nothing was handed to us, we had to decipher a lot of their backstory episode by episode, and we had to piece the stories ourselves.
In the end, however, everything came in a crash, and the entirety of these small plots came into a flashy dystopic climax!
Art/Animation:
The animation was flawless. Even without considering that this a show made 14 years ago, I was thoroughly impressed with the fluidity of every episodes. All of the fighting sequences left me breathless, and kept me at the edge of my feet!
The character designs reminded me a lot of Samurai Champloo...and I was pleasantly surprised to read that there are of similar origins, same director. 
I will add that this anime, out of all the animes that I've watched so far, had the greatest amount of diversity in terms of characters. It was not all just Japanese people who conquered and repopulated the universe but also Indians, Arabs, Africans, and Americans ( thinking of a certain cowboy hehehe)
I really enjoyed seeing this diversity because that is more representative of how the world actually is.
A lot of anime directors nowdays should take not of how to budget and direct these episodes, CB showed the way. This is how you get it done guys!
Sound:
Just like every anime review that I do, I stress the importance of sound/bgm as a contributor of the making of a masterpiece. Without a great accompany soundtrack, an anime cannot be called a masterpiece in my eyes. Sound sets the atmosphere faster than any of the senses that we have. It is of the utmost importance to have the best compatible soundtrack.
CowBoy Bebop doesn't disappoint on this end either. The soundtrack is strong. It is a mixture of different sounds from the sixties, a lot of jazzy records, and soothing blues. The soundtrack really contributes to the effects that CB is portraying, the smoothness of Spike, the sneakiness of Faye, and the tough righteousness of Jet are all represented well through the music. There are couple of pieces that I will later try to find for personal enjoyment. Really smooth soundtrack. 
Characters:
This anime is made by and for the characters. We don't have any ingenious plot line, or any non-fulfilling fan service...what we have is plenty of character development. Obviously, this is going to be the biggest part of the review since I will discuss in detail my opinion of each character.
Edward:      Is this a person a girl or a boy? The ambiguity of her gender plagued my thoughts throughout the show. Anytime I was convinced that she was a girl, someone would come along and challenge those beliefs. In all practicality, she was probably a girl. I really expected a lot from her when she was introduced, she seemed witty and smart, but also caring. She, however, did not live up to my expectations, probably becoming the least of the main characters in CB.
Faye:     I didn't enjoy her at first. She seemed too snotty for her own good. Usually characters of her type bring nothing but randomness and chaos to a story line, and I've never been a fan of that. She did surprise me around mid series however. She was a lot more deep than what I gave her credit for. Without delving into any spoilers, I found myself empathizing with her emotional distraught about her past life and ended up becoming a big fan of hers. I wish that she would have had more episodes where she was a bit more honest with her feelings, the tough girl act can only take you so far, but due to the 26 episode limit, I was thoroughly satisfied by the end with this character's development.
Jet:         My favorite character of the series. Jet is a balding middle age gentleman with a huge biceps and a big personality to follow along with it. At first, I thought he was going to stay one dimensional, usually characters of his type are not examined enough in anime, but again CB surprised me by giving me a glimpse of who Jet was in the past, and some of his reasoning. We saw him grow as he finally decided to not look to the past anymore, and I related a lot with that. A lot of the time, in my personal life, I've been tied to the past, whether it was a past version of myself, a past friend, a past job or school...a past lover....I found myself always looking back and reminiscing and it hasn't been until recently that I decided to put the past where it belongs, learn from it, and strive for the future. I love Jet because his development is an incarnation of the feelings that I've also developed. His friendship with Jet was unorthodox but really enjoyable to see. Sometimes, the people with opposite personalities find ways to become the closest of friends. Their constant bickering was like classical music to my ears, and their silence was brutally sad. They seemed to be really good at synchronizing with each other.
Spike:         The main character of the show, and the man with few words. Spike is a really interesting character because of his nonchalant attitude. It is really enjoyable to see him in action, he is so smooth in his fighting style that you are surprised by his efficiency. He is one smooth mamajama. His story intrigued me the most, I was really curious to know what his relationship to Julia was and why she was so important. Unfortunately, by the end, I didn't see why Julia was so important. It could have been better to maybe have separate episodes with just her, so we could understand better and empathize with who she was. Maybe it wasn't the director's intent for us to understand Julia but rather understand the emotional connection that Spike had with her. If that is the case, then yes, I did get that Spike really loved her...to the point that he would have died a thousand times to be with her. Spike was always indifferent to most situations, but any time Vicious, and Julia was mentioned he would go into ape mode or get moody. Nothing is wrong with that, but I would have liked further knowledge about that story line. I think if I rewatched the series, I would not recall these issues. All in all, I do like Spike as a character, he's funny, witty, and a good person at heart. A classy main character.
Side characters: Most of the side characters were just introduced and left in the same episode, very few carried over to other episode, and I guess that's the point of the episodic format. CB really did a good job of fleshing out these characters during the one shot episodes and making them deep and relatable. This wasn't achieved in all of the episodes, but it was well done in most.  
Enjoyment:
The episodes that I enjoyed....I enjoyed to its fullest extent, but the ones that I didn't like were really a drag. Those dragging episodes though were mostly in the first ten episodes. Overall, I really enjoyed the anime. 
I originally gave this anime an 8/10, which is a decent grade, but after taking into consideration the time period when this anime was made, I cannot downgrade the effort and care that was put into making it. I boosted it up to an 9/10...aren't I merciful? :) haha
Well, the anime wasn't the masterpiece that people made it out to be, I came in with super high expectations, but this was a great anime. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I recommend anyone with a normal concentration span to try CowBoy Bebop out.",9,yogotah,

                After watching first episode, I thought this is just another episodic animes, which doesn't have any relation with one another. But it wasn't. It will take you by surprise, by how the story travels, how the characters relate, how the story is or the best of all, how the awesome sound gels with the story and give it a high value. I prefer this to any anime newcomer and I don't deny it will take them as a surprise.
Story: 8/10
The first few episodes you will feel like, is there any story at all. But I bet, it is, and damn what a story it is.
                  At first glance, it is just another bounty hunter in alternate universe, but it so much more than that. And it is hard to explain without giving spoilers, so I contain myself not to reveal, but it is one hell of a story.
Art: 8/10
I was quite awestruck with the art style. Can't believe it came a decade ago, but nonetheless, it is refreshing. It is far better than lot of crap, that is being aired these days.
Sound: 9/10
One of the best OST in anime,I have ever heard. Don't go by my Anime List, I have heard a lot and it is easily one of the best. I seriously doubt this show would have received such accolades if not for the OST.

Characters are unique yet not so hard to understand. Each of the have nice back story which unfold over time. And all of them all excellent and it cruise along with the story. It compliments the story and does great job.
Enjoyment: 9/10
Damn, this anime has everything. Humor, Action and what not. I thoroughly enjoyed it and except a couple of filler episodes, I was totally blasted away with the show. I binge-watched the show after certain episode. as I couldn't wait any longer. It is seriously addictive.

                Let Cowboy Bebop serve as an example of why I consider praise for a series to be a spoiler in and of itself. For decades I have heard nothing but exaltation for Cowboy Bebop, and in the face of that kind of overwhelming critical and cult acclamation... it's hard not to be disappointed. If someone leads you to believe you will have your mind blown and your life changed, anything less makes the whole thing feel like they've made you put on a damp sweater. 
Maybe Cowboy Bebop is best considered within a particular social timeframe and cultural mindset. Maybe Cowboy Bebop is great because
                  of the effect it had on a genre. Because I came to Cowboy Bebop almost two-decades late, however, none of that can bear upon my review of it. I can only review it as I experienced it. This is to say, I thought Cowboy Bebop was on the high side of okay.
I like the characters. They're fun, they're interesting, they have some depth (but not a lot of growth). I like the world and the setting. The series passed the time. That's kind of where it ends for me. Perhaps it's a matter of taste, but I'm not very interested in episodic, short-term story telling and I wish that there'd been a series-long arc covering the dealings with the Syndicate to tie everything together. As it is, each episode is just a cast of characters doing a bunch of random crap and remaining unchanged as a result. This kind of storytelling is deeply dissatisfying for me--there's a reason why serialized dramas are ruling TV these days and why self-contained procedural dramas don't win awards. 
Ultimately, I was disappointed that Cowboy Bebop didn't strive to do more, to BE more, given the perfect cast, setting, and set-up for an engaging high-concept story. Bebop is a series that is better discovered at random--late night on TV or on a shelf in a 00's video store--than it is discovered due to its acclaim. It's better experienced for what it is than for what it could or should have been.",6,paedanticbasterd,

                The Music: Jazz, blues, acoustic ballads, hard rock, country funk. Yoko Kannos' work is pure genius.(You might also be aware of her work from The Ghost in shell series)
From the opening theme song ""Tank"", to chase sequence music such as ""Bad Dog No Biscuit"", to ""Space lion"" or the awesome ""What planet is this?"". The music is pitch perfect and suits the setting of the anime elegantly.
The Characters: Cowboy Bebop's characters are as realistic a one can get. What is great about the series is that it maintains the mortality of main characters. This team is not a bunch of all powerful god like super-humans
                  who can kick anyone's ass simply by their ""will power""   (Goku..cough cough..Naruto cough cough...Shonen cough cough)
This team is all too real, they have their problems, they can be overpowered and they can die.
The Voice Actors: I have never seen another anime which compares to the same level of English dub as this this series, okay maybe Baccano!
The voice actors used have done a really really good job. I just cannot picture Spike Spiegel without Steve Blums' voice in my head.
I mean really, one of the best dubs evaaarr.
The Bruce Lee element: Chances are you find Spike Spiegel's fighting style jaw-dropping awesome. Have you ever wondered what what type of style is that?
It's Jeet Kun do which ""is an electric/hybrid style of no style and philosophy of life founded by martial artist [The great]Bruce Lee.""
That is not the best part. Not only is Spike practitoner of Jeet Kun Do but also follows Bruce Lee's philosophy of life.
Noir-CyperPunk-SpaceWestern: Holy shit, this anime has all three of them. The technology depicted in the anime is fascinating probably because it still uses wires which gives it an interesting aspect because we all know the future will be nothing like that.
Humor: Cowboy Bebop is anything if not funny. The classic Spike and Jet situations are very humorous. Not only that, the recurring characters such as the three old men, and Punch and Judy from the T.V show Big Shot can put a smile to anyone's face.
For me Cowboy Bebop has evolved beyond as an anime. It is a culture.",10,pratulbagri,

                Short Review: (I know, I know, I gave Cowboy Bebop less than a 10/10) Almost everything about this anime is of extremely high quality, especially considering we're talking about an anime that's more than 15 years old. Pitch-perfect English dub, a vast bout incredible OST, unique characters, and incredibly fluid animation. HOWEVER. I did not expect an episodic story, and this led me to almost hate the anime at times. 
Looooooooong review: 
Story:
Before watching this anime, my expectations for Cowboy Bebop were astronomically high, pun somewhat intended. Having known this cult classic's reputation, I was sorely disappointed to find out Cowboy Bebop is an episodic
                  series, something that was conveniently left out in every review I had come across (I don't really like episodic shows). I was expecting this epic space opera tale filled with drama and complex characters, which Bebop only fully delivered the latter. A lot of this anime's story goes something like, ""There's a new bounty on a criminal!"" ""Let's catch him/her!"" Stuff goes wrong, fights ensue, then things look up, the problem is (somewhat) solved, and in the end, the crew gets (almost) nothing. Episodes that do not involve trying to catch a criminal usually involve the antics of one of the crew members, something which the writers must have had a lot of fun coming up with. Occasionally, some other stuff is sprinkled in, mostly involving someone/thing from one of the crew's past. This is where the main theme of the show comes in, as every crew member gets at least 1 episode dealing with their past and how they handle it. This method of storytelling left much to desired from me, because for every great and very enjoyable episode, there was one that made me feel very annoyed and facepalm a lot. And there were only about 10 ""plot"" episodes in the whole series. However, the anime did keep me interested by ending the episodes in a way that most people wouldn't expect. This was probably the most interesting part of the show. The narrative of Cowboy Bebop does not ever do the ""info dump"" many sci-fi series are guilty of. Because of this, the writing may seem ""masterful"" but for me, a few times I spent the first few minutes of an episode wondering just what was going on. Once again, maybe I just wasn't ""mature enough"" for this anime. Cowboy Bebop makes the unique genres of Space Western and Neo-Noir work together exceedingly well, which is probably what contributed to this anime's popularity. As for the ending, I don't think I could have written a better ending to this anime. It's just one of those where it lightly hangs in the air, waiting for its full effect to sink in. It felt like everything was tied up in the story, but not in the ""fast-forward"" way others shows end.
Characters:
I do give praise to the characters in Cowboy Bebop, as every one of them is unique and not lazily written. They all have their deep motivations for why they do what they do, and it's usually isn't a cliche reason. The best part about this is as you see more about the characters, it becomes more interesting to watch their dynamic, them growing and reacting to their surroundings, because everyone is so non-cliche. Every member of the Bebop crew is very likable and has a fleshed-out personality, with Spike being effortlessly smooth and cool, Jet being a (reluctant) voice of reason, Faye being the strong female lead with no romantic feelings for Spike (shocker), and Ed being ridiculously enigmatic and childish, but never annoying. Even Ein had his moments of being very necessary to what was going on throughout this anime. It's because everyone aboard the Bebop is so different from one another, this rag-tag team feeling did push the story into many great moments and episodes. They highlight each other's flaws, but also make each other stronger, despite all their bickering. Secondary characters are usually in only one episode each, because this is an episodic series. Characters siding with our protagonists usually change by the end of an episode, and the ""bad guys"" were all unique, mostly memorable, and fun to watch get chased down by the Bebop crew. The real bad guys, Vicious and the Red Dragon syndicate, made interesting antagonists, despite their roots in western movie cliches. They were threatening, but not enough that it becomes the focus of the show. All the character designs were both unique and creative, which brings me to my next point...
Art:
I really do have to tip my hat (if I was wearing one right now) to the art style of this anime. It's very 90's, while having its own unique style. Yes, it very much looks like anime, but the style is also westernized, blending the two in a beautiful harmony. The one thing that Cowboy Bebop really left an impression on me is that the art (actually, most of this anime) is undeniably stylish and unique. I really loved how all the sci-fi elements looked gritty and realistic, while the aspects closer to present-day were incredibly detailed, almost as if the animators took real buildings and setting and transformed them into anime. The art perfectly blends the western and sci-fi elements in a way I would have thought would never have worked. 
Animation:
Cowboy Bebop is one of the last anime series to be made entirely by traditional cel animation, drawing each and every single frame by hand. But for it's time, the animation is incredibly fluid and consistent throughout the entire series, something which was a problem for other shows using the same animation method (cough Evangelion cough). Heck, I'd even say the animation quality of Cowboy Bebop is equal to, if not greater than some of the stuff that's being made today, 16 years later. All the action is as effortless as Spike's fighting style, and the animators took great care in making sure everything in this anime looked realistic, somewhat gritty, and absolutely amazing. Only very few clips of recycled animation were used, and the only ones I can think of are when the Bebop flies through hyperspace and those yellow gates. Clearly Cowboy Bebop had a large budget, and it was used to its full potential by not skimping on animation.
Voice:
This is a no-brainer, but I say watch Cowboy Bebop dubbed. Part of the reason this anime is so famous here in the west is because of its amazing dub. While it actually took me a few episodes to get used to the voices, especially when a new member of the crew was introduced, the dub quickly grew on me, but did did hit a few bumps in the road here and there. Steve Blum is probably most well known for playing Spike, and the same can be said about Wendee Lee playing Faye. All the voice actors clearly had a lot of fun dubbing this, and they gave it their all and it payed off. The script is witty, the delivery for all the actors was (95% of the time) pitch-perfect, and added to the style and overall feel of the anime. The dub just feels so much more stylish, while reading subs usually just give you the raw translation. With a western prime audience in mind, Bandai made sure this dub was of the best quality, and it is one that is considered the best dubs in all of anime. Even Shinichiro Watanabe, the Japanese director, says the English dub is better. 
Music:
The opening theme, ""Tank!"" has lent itself to be one of the most iconic anime openings of all time, being a) instrumental and b) as stylish and jazzy as the rest of the show. In case the title of this anime didn't clue you in, almost the entire soundtrack is inspired from jazz or classic western movie music. Even some of the episode names are classic American rock songs (Bohemian Rhapsody) or albums (Toys in the Attic). Yes, this does lend this anime ""cool"" points, but the sheer number of tracks in the OST (93!!!) means that you won't hear a lot of them very often. There are a few exceptions, like the music box theme whenever Spike's past came up. Some songs are slow, some are quick, some are sad, and some are kinda goofy. Yoko Kanno has proven that she can compose a completely amazing soundtrack, and this is one of her most famous works. The first ending theme actually wasn't that impressive, but the second ending theme, used only for the last episode, had my mouth gaping open by how it matched the tone of the show's ending perfectly. It very much reminded me of ""The World of Midnight"" from Black Lagoon.
Execution:
I failed to recognize while I was watching this anime that it was designed to appeal to a western audience with its episodic storytelling and not being like typical anime of the time. While most seasoned anime fans and critics regard Cowboy Bebop as a ""cult classic,"" the two words I would use to describe this anime are stylish and westernized. I don't think Cowboy Bebop necessarily failed, I just went in with the wrong mindset and impressions of the show. In other words, Cowboy Bebop's reputation precedes itself, but not by a long shot. Sure, this anime passes style with flying colors, but it seemed to me at first to lack the meat and potatoes, aka an overarching rich story. But I am one to agree this would make a good (but not the best) first anime and a great way to get fathers or brothers into anime. 
My Enjoyment:
Because I went into this anime with such high expectations, my enjoyment was hindered very much so. As I clicked on the next episode, I kept telling myself, ""Okay, this is it. We're actually going to see some overarching plot or an entertaining episode."" only to be disappointed 25 minuted later. I'm a bit hesitant to call this anime ""overrated,"" but again, I just think my problem was that I went into this show with the wrong mindset. Sure, there were plenty of entertaining episodes, but there were more that had disappointed or just made me feel weird (not in the good way). The creativity involved for the more slice-of-life episodes is remarkable, but I can't help but feel a sort of grudge against this anime for ""letting me down."" Sure, I could go back and watch this series again (with the proper mindset) but I think my enjoyment of this series was ruined from the moment I caught wind of this anime's extreme reputation. Cowboy Bebop is the kind of anime to just pick up an episode or two, kick back, and relax. Enjoy the memorable characters, creative episodes, vast soundtrack, and the excellent dub. But don't watch it because ""You're not a real anime fan if you haven't seen Cowboy Bebop hurrr hurrr."" That is NEVER a good reason to watch an anime, and if anyone says something like that to you, tell them to shut up.

                Cowboy Bebop is by far my favorite anime. Its got a great story that keeps the viewer entertained, laughing, and at some parts on the verge of tears that said I would like to say that I love the jazzy kinda dark feel of the overall anime and think that it was done very well. On the other hand I feel like it was pretty short... which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing because they didn\'t milk it for every dime like some newer anime but It leaves the viewer yearning for more.

                There are only two anime series/OVA/movie I've seen.  Cowboy Bebop and Fullmetal Alchemist are the only ones.
Cowboy Bebop follows Spike, Jet, Faye and Edward as bounty hunters aboard the spaceship Bebop.  Now onto the many reasons why this anime series is perfect.
First the story:  Which blends comedy, drama, action, adventure, Sci-fi and even some romance perfectly like no other show.  Most of the series are one episode stories yet I think are all connected in the development of the characters.  The story of each individual episode is done perfectly giving a beginning a middle and end with no lose ends.
                   The action is brilliant and I still haven't seen anything to compare to it.  Finally we have the last few episodes leading to the ending.  I won't give anything away to the people who unfortunately haven't seen this series, just it will blow you away.
Second the characters:  Again done perfectly.  Each character has their own unique personality who grows as the show goes along.  Spike who used to work for Red Dragon crime organization and his haunted by his past.  Jet a former police officer who is now working with a criminal, and his haunted by the mistake he made in the past.  Faye who awakes from a 54 year cryogenic sleep with no memory of her past, who lives for the moment.  Finally Edward a eccentric computer genius, who ran away from her father.  Each character brings life to the series and draws you in caring about what happens to each of them.
Third the animation:  The animation done by Sunrise is simply brilliant, and is still amazing after 10 years.
Forth the soundtrack:  The music to the series is the perhaps the greatest soundtrack to anime series ever.  It has a little of everything from Rock, classic, Jazz, Heavy Metal and others.  Each adding something extra to the series.  I even have the soundtrack to the series
Fifth the Influence:  Cowboy Bebop has Influenced many series much like Trigun.  Shows like BLACK LAGOON, SAMURAI CHAMPLOO, and others.  I think that's a great compliment.
Overall Cowboy Bebop is a perfect anime series and is must to any anime fan.",10,Huntsman,

Cowboy Bebop is most likely one of the most famous anime out there. And it is, for very good reasons. It's a classic, and one of the first anime with a good English dub. The anime takes place in the future, following the adventures of Spike and Jet, bounty hunters (or cowboys) looking for cash. As they go about their adventures, they pick up a lady (Faye Valentine), a dog (Ein), and a boy (who's really a girl named Ed). Many things happen to them, and you eventually learn more about Spike and his interesting background.
Story - 9/10
While having what is IMO
                  the best ending possible in any anime, it has too many filler episodes that don't have anything to do with the actual plot. This would be fine, if they actual episodes were very good, but some of them have barely anything to do with hunting down criminals, such as the one where they purchase some sketchy mushrooms. Otherwise the main plot line of the show is amazing, and the ending wraps it all up very nicely. The backstory of some of the characters is also what makes this show fantastic.
Art - 10/10
Even though it is a very old show, it still stands up there as one of the best drawn anime I've ever seen. The animation during fights is fantastic, especially for it's time and I've never seen anything like it when I first saw it on T.V. Characters are well drawn with realistic features, nothing too exaggerated like most animes nowaday.
Sound - 10/10
Oh boy, where do I even start. This show has what I want to say the best soundtrack of any anime I've ever seen in my entire life. Maybe it's my bias because it's one of the first anime I've ever seen, but The Seatbelts did an amazing job and the ending theme song (The Real Folk Blues) is one of my favorite songs of all time. I constantly hum it almost all the time in fact, and some of my colleagues have even been interested to know here it is from.
And the English dub is one of the first best ones out there. I really felt the emotions in this dub unlike most other dubs which are just bland. However, this one definitely stands out in terms of english dub quality. 
Character - 9/10
While the show did an amazing job developing Spike's and Jet's characters, I felt that Vicious and the others could've been done a little better. I still felt like I wanted to know more about them, but sadly the show didn't deliver on that aspect. However, for sure, they did an amazing job for what they did develop.
Enjoyment - 10/10
I love this anime. It's another of the ones that I grew up with, and it still sticks with me even today. It was the show that really stood out to me, and probably the one that got me into watching even more anime. Even after re-watching it recently, I still felt compelled to watch it again because that's how I much I enjoyed it. The fight scenes were splendid, the ending stunning, soundtrack fantastic, there was almost no downsides, and for the ones that it has, it makes up for two fold.

                The short ass review:
I love this show. 10/10
The actual review: 
I love me some 90's anime, its quite good. I could go on for ages on how much I goddamn love this show. I could be a grown ass man by the time I'm done. But instead, I'll give a short 5 paragraph version of why I love this show.
Cowboy Bebop takes place in space with 2 bounty hunters (Spike & Jet) making cash off killing people. Later on they find a bad-ass women (Faye), a person who still after 17 years, nobody has any idea of it's sex (Edward) and a goddamn dog. We're
                  given enough information to work with for these characters as we meet them. It's not too much nor too little. As the show goes on, we delve deeper and deeper into the characters as we learn about their pasts. And that's really what the show revolves around, the history of a bounty hunter (Spike Spiegel) who has done a lot of bad shit which I won't talk about cause duh, spoilers. But it is real emotional. It even gets emotional for the other characters.
I love every character in this show, extra, side, main, doesn't matter. Each character has a personality and a backstory to them. Spike is a wise man with badass karate moves, life lessons and generally a backstory to cry over. Jet, man, who doesn't wanna be this guy? He's just cool and chill, he gets the job done, handles situations. Just a cool character. Faye Valentine is really a broken character who is trying to learn her past. And when you do learn it, you feel so sad for this character. Edward is wacky and love them. Enough said.
The animation is really well done even for a  1999 anime. For being some of the last anime to use hand drawn animation, it really is impressive. The music, ah. Man, the music. It's a mix of jazz and blues. Fuck me it's amazing. Each track is filled to the brim with amazing music. The opening is orgasmic and the ending is calming and just a beauty. 
Overall, this show is just bad-ass. That's the one word I can say about this show. It has good storytelling, likable characters, superb animation and orgasmic music. If I can say a couple of minor issues. The first 4 episodes are extremely slow paced and try to introduce you to the show, but trust me. It sure may be a little boring, but after those 4 episodes. Episodes 5 & 6 are simply not only some of the best episodes of the show, but the best episodes in all of anime and TV. That's the only complaint I have with this show. So please, do yourself a favor and go watch this masterpiece. Also, watch the English dub, this is one of the only times I prefer dub over sub.",10,JKinky88,

                These are just my vague thoughts about the show, not particularly organized or backed up with specific details from the show itself.  Probably not the best way to write a review, but I am basically just here to praise the show and state what I liked :]
Amazing series.  Despite the fact it's episodic, you can see a connected story line through the characters and the way they and their relationships develop. 
I truly loved every character on the Bebop-- they all filled different roles without seeming forced.  They all had pasts that affected them even if we don't ever fully learn what
                  their past is.  Character relationships and growth are what I look for in a series, and this one nailed it.  Also, this series has Edward!  Can anybody NOT love her?  I don't think so.
Cowboy Bebop had a really nice mix of humor, seriousness, darkness, and suspense.  The jokes and the banter between the characters always felt genuine and made me smile.  The show really knew how to have silly moments while still remaining mature.
I am not a big fan of tons of action and gun fights or space-themed things.  But this series made me like it.  It made it believable--  the story's universe was built so well that everything felt real while watching it.
The show can be appreciated for the individual episodes as well as the overall themes, the biggest of which is whether or not your past makes you who you are.  An over-done theme, perhaps, but Bebop's take on it was really well done because you could see it from so many points of view.
I'm not one to normally notice soundtracks because I am so focused on the story and the visuals, but Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack definitely stuck out to me.  I loved it.  The music always helped improve the scenes and the mood and was never a distraction.
The art is unique and beautiful in its own way, especially from being nearly 15 years old now.
In the end, I would recommend this series to anyone and everyone.  It started off slow for me but when I took the time and patience to appreciate it, I couldn't turn it off.  I definitely think there's a lot of rewatch value in the series as well, and I can't wait to show it to more people.",10,LeighManga,

                I hazard to award any series a full-blown ten, as I see the ranking more as a place to compare everything else to than an actual spot where anything belongs. Unless it's Cowboy Bebop...
The episodic structure gradually reveals more and more about the characters while bouncing between tones and still being able to be taken as seriously or silly as it wants. With a plot that isn't exceptionally complicated, the pacing and delivery manages to make it exceptionally compelling. 
The visual style screams ""cool"" with fights given loving attention and characters moving around and interacting with interesting worlds. 
The music...
Sublime standing by itself, the Seatbelts
                  blend of jazzy cool, contemporary mixes, and some American cowboy couldn't be imitated and hasn't been done since. 
 The characters are excellently portrayed and acted, with personalities that are crystal clear and enjoyable to watch. I honestly can't think of much else to say that won't come across as gushing; they're superb!
This series blew so many standard prejudices I had against anime out of the water. Here is an anime, where less is more. Less talking, less byzantine plots, less tacked-on elements, just tons of atmosphere and personality. Truly the bearer of the cup of which to baptize neophyte western Otaku, Cowboy Bebop is a series I cherish to revisit alone and with friends, and plan to do so for many years to come.

There's something about this anime that sets itself apart from everything else out there. From its amazing atmosphere to its near-flawless character design, this anime is a surefire way to make a boring weekend a lot less boring. I had heard so much about this show from many different sources, but I had never tried to watch it. Only because of a sudden urge to watch anime was I able to fully grasp how good this show is.
Let me just say that the intro is definitely something to drool over like some mindless fanboy. And I don't say that often. A good intro may
                  not affect the story, but it can really draw in viewers.

The soundtrack really is unique, and I haven't seen anything else quite like it. It can go from smooth and classy to quick and dangerous in a matter of a few seconds and you wouldn't know what hit you. The soundtrack alone is a good reason why you should watch this anime.
ART:

As for the art? It might be a bit outdated, but... you know, that's because it came out in 1998. But even for its release date, it showed an exceptional amount of care and passion.

STORY: (Obvious spoilers.)

While the story might seem everywhere to some people, it's clearly meant to be that way. Each story arc offered a unique setting and progression. From an intelligent dog comparable to a human being to a pathogen bomb that has the ability to wipe out an entire population on a planet, you're in for a ride, folks. But I don't want to spoil any more for you. Just know that you'll be missing out if you don't watch this anime.
CHARACTERS: (Yes. Take all of my virtual yes.)
The character design and progression is something I rarely see in shows nowadays, excluding some of the more successful shows out there. Those are successful for a reason. I particularly love the smooth personality of the main character, and the uncle-like friendliness (While still possessing copious amounts of badassary) of his companion. There are a few more notable characters, but I'll leave them to you to discover.

                Ok, I knew this was an episodic anime going into it. I'm not the biggest fan of those but with everything I've heard about the show and how great it is I decided to give it a go. First couple episodes were pretty good so I thought 'I can get through this.' Cut to ep. 15 and now I'm struggling to finish it. The sound and dub are amazing, I'm not denying that but the story suffers majorly here. There's no real over arcing story line other than Faye's story and Spike's and even then they are really only mentioned in the second half with
                  everything else feeling like they're fillers. The animation was nice with it before the digitization age with it feeling dark and everything with no real noticeable flaws. 
When we first see Julia and thereafter, I couldn't of cared less about her even after everything. I knew nothing about her or anything. Spike's backstory was jammed into the last two episodes with a couple hints throughout the anime so when the final two episodes happened it just seemed out of the blue which might be why I was so annoyed at the ending. I thought that something else was going to happen and it didn't. 
I especially didn't care didn't care about Edward. When she left I couldn't help but cheer. What was the point to her character being on Bebop? I couldn't understand. Yes, she's a hacker but that's all. And the way she spoke rubbed me the wrong way and felt so childish and out of place in the show. Not to mention she wasn't there for very long so again, I wondered what her purpose there was. 
Faye was amazing. I know some people don't like her but I enjoyed her character especially after we learn parts of her backstory which made her more intriguing in my mind. Her character was consistent through the show but there was some character development which was nice (unlike Edward). I couldn't help but laugh at her and Spike going back and forth.
Jet is an interesting one because even though he owns the ship Spike seemed to be the one in charge-most of the time. Jet will put his foot down and argue if he has to. There's a few other things that I can't think of right now but suffice to say I enjoyed him.
Spike...pretty much a walking contradiction until the last couple episodes but I won't grip about that here. He can be ruthless but compassionate. He tells Faye to stop living in the past when that's all he does and so forth. 
The show down between him and Vicious felt cheap I'm not going to lie but it did. The very ending I wasn't expecting but again, I felt a but cheated with how quick everything went. If that story line was the over arcing one throughout the whole series and that finale was stretched to three episodes instead of two than I think it could have worked better and flesh out Vicious a bit more because I couldn't of care less when the fight was going on since he didn't really seem like a villain to me. Maybe it's because I didn't watch the movie but he didn't really do it for me as a bad guy. 
Overall, if you like Bebop that's good. I had trouble with it because it was so light humoured until the last couple episodes so the tone was everywhere and it was purely episodic. Not to mention some of the characters did it in for me so I can gladly say I watched it but probably won't be one I'll rewatch.",7,Princess101855,

                What is the measure of a classic? 
The dictionary would suggest that a classic is: n. is an outstanding example of a particular style; something of lasting worth or with a timeless quality; of the first or highest quality, class, or rank – something that exemplifies its class. Something that stands the test of time, is remembered fondly, and has continued appeal. 
Historically, the world classic itself typically imbues a connotation of antiquity- Greeks, Romans, ancient literature, artwork, even music. It inspires originality and derives from that a long-lasting impact.
The audience would likely suggest a less abstract definition and instead give examples. In film, you'd
                  get a Citizen Kane or a Sunset Boulevard or a Rear Window. In television, a wider range of things.
There are even such things as ""modern classics"", like my beloved Ringtone Rap.
In anime, the definition of classic- well... that debate is still hotly contested. One name, that continually rises up through sifting of the ever growing mound of coarse sand that is anime however, is that of Cowboy Bebop. 
Bebop checks off all the boxes for an enduring, beloved series- it has the characters, it's easy to follow, it's got the tunes, a tightly controlled artistic direction that sets it apart from the rest of the pack, and most importantly- it's entertaining. There is a reason why certain shows like Seinfeld, Spongebob, Andy Griffith, The Flintstones, Friends, Star Trek, and many others continued to air on TV long after their expiration date: accessibility. Many of the longest running shows on television center on a long running, slow unfolding story arc, often involving a large family or group of them- such as Dallas, the Sopranos, or Game of Thrones. They tell interwoven stories with a myriad of characters over a period of years, and as such, length of the show is hampered only by the creative output of the creators. 
To create such a show that, within its relatively short length of 26 episodes (everything listed above numbers in the hundreds of episodes, or will, by the end of the run) manages to cover such a wide range of topics and stories in a self contained format is a feat indeed. One of the most common criticisms of scripted shows like this are their episodic or short arc nature. The people want a singular story to follow- a goal, a direction. Episodic series often feel uneven in tone and pacing, not to mention disjointed due to the constant shift and restarting that's necessary to keep the show accessible to new viewers who may not have seen previous episodes. 
Cowboy Bebop doesn't necessarily rely on viewers to have seen all of the preceding episodes to be able to enjoy any given episode, and to me, this is one of the great charms the show has- the ability to pick it up wherever, and enjoy it. I think this is also why it's had lasting success on Adult Swim since its original airing in 2001. Bebop is a lot of fun to watch, no matter where in the series you pick it up; and that enjoyability is due in no small part to the writing and direction. Certain long running shows can have very interesting plots, and be loaded with poorly written characters, but still manage to garner a large viewing audience who want to follow along- shows that have intriguing concepts, but poor execution. 
For an episodic series like Bebop to succeed, the emphasis doesn't necessarily need to be on making every single story plot the most interesting and wacky thing out there, but rather to be anchored by /characters/ you want to watch interact and react to situations. Indeed, it is characters that drive this story, and not the other way around. 
A show's greatest sin is to be unentertaining. If a show is ""boring"", it has failed at its' most fundamental level- being entertainment. 
Boring, Bebop is not. The characters are unique, and how they work, play, and fight together is decidedly endearing. Each character has their charm and their wit. Spike, the central protagonist, is a mysterious James Bond-esque man of many skills- particularly in combat. Throughout the show, there are several overarching questions about his past, which are revealed through about 5 episodes throughout. However, this kind of information about the character is really just a bonus, because it takes all of one episode to know what kind of character he is: the sharp dressing, sardonic, quintessential cool- cigarettes, guns and all. He's not without depth or flaws, however. There's more behind the man than the mask of calm, cool, and collected. 
He is set opposite the very antithesis of calm, cool and collected in Faye- a beautiful young woman with an equally mysterious past that's explored in several later episodes. She plays an important role in the team though, instead of just being the token female or there for fanservice. She's another multifaceted character with more than meets the eye, and frequently steals the spotlight. 
The trio is rounded off with Jet- the ""I'm too old for this crap"" retired cop archetype. Jet exists as the grounded personality between Spike's frustration and Faye's outbursts, and generally serves as the voice of reason between the two extremes: his crewmates, hothead and impulsive. 
Soundwise, the show is superb. I make no secret of being a fan of Yoko Kanno, but this is the show that catapulted her to stardom in the anime industry. It's got a fantastic blend of moody orchestral pieces juxtaposed with the titular bebop jazz. There's funk, there's electronica, and there's even an episode devoted to heavy metal. A more diverse soundtrack you are unlikely to find, and there will certainly be something for everyone to enjoy with such a variety of tunes. As far as the voice acting goes, Steve Blum, Wendee Lee, and Beau Billingslea all do fantastic jobs as Spike, Faye, and Jet respectively. 
The art, too, is fantastic for the time. In 2017, Bebop could be considered an ""old"" anime, clocking in at a geriatric 19 years of age. Don't let the number fool you though, as the hand drawn art maintains a great consistency in quality and fluidity throughout the show's run. The show features a great variety in locales, vehicles, and characters. Due to the episodic nature, very few episodes take place in the same locations, and a number of different themes in art direction show up in the show. There are full on neo-noir episodes, complete with the black and white look, detectives, etc. and other more darkly colored ones with slow fades to reveal a what looks to be a puddle is actually blood. There are a number of western themed episodes, mafia, casino, and others. Definitely no shortage of different motifs. 
One of my favorite episodes was the magic mushroom episode, where, due to a food shortage, Spike, Faye, and Jet all end up eating psychedelic mushrooms they've mistaken for portabellas, and it's up to Edward to actually track down some real food. Though it's a silly episode played for laughs, it actually succeeds in taking a needed break from the action. The ""Pierrot Le Fou"" episode, which reminded me heavily of the 1992 Batman Animated series, involves a superhuman test subject that resembles The Penguin, who loses his mind and goes nuts, attacking anyone and everyone. The episode is downright creepy, and Spike's showdown with him at the end is quite clever, and, as mentioned before- really seems like a Batman episode. 
That said, and being episodic, some episodes are a mixed bag. A few that are supposed to be touching just felt a bit out of place, and others that were more comedic in tone fell a bit flat when it involved someone other than the main three. The recurring ""Spike and Faye manage to screw up somehow and lose the bounty they're hunting, or they unexpectedly die"" gag wears thin pretty quickly, and the formulaic nature of the first few episodes gets kinda old, too. The second half of the show is definitely where it all comes together though, and the ending was rather unexpected for a show of this type, and succeeded in grabbing me by the heart. 
All that to say: Cowboy Bebop is exactly what I would consider to be a classic.  
See you, Space Cowboy.",9,lawlmartz,

                Cowboy Bebop is a hugely influential anime from the late 90s. It was brought to us by Sunrise. Yes, them again. You'd think they'd been around since the 70s and had done a tonne of works. But yes, the Dirty Pair, Gundam, Love Live & Witch Hunter Robin studio is back. Now, I have seen Cowboy Bebop before so I won't be going into it blind. Rather, it'll be one of those series I re-watch. I will say that I remember it being quite good but it's possible that that'll change since it's been about a decade since I saw it last. Let's find out.
                  
Story:
we open with our heroes, Spike & Jet in a state of financial trouble. Fortunately for them, they have a plan to get some credits to their name. They just have to go out and hunt some bounties. This is one of those series where there's not much in terms of an underlying story. Most of the episodes deal with the Bebop crew going on various missions to hunt bounties and they follow a linear path with certain missions very clearly taking place after others. 
One of the most impressive elements in the series is the way it handles tone. Cowboy Bebop has some more comedic portions. It also has some dark and depressing moments and it handles all of them, and the transitions betwixt them, very well. A big part of that is simply that it doesn't go too extreme with either. Its comedic moments are more of the “life can be weird & fun” variety. It avoids the over the top zany type of comedy. And its dark scenes aren't the super dark “we're trying far too hard to be edgy and extreme” type and are more subdued. And that's what the success with tone comes down to, Cowboy Bebop excels at having scenes that feel pretty true to life. In spite of involving a crew of bounty hunters travelling in a space ship and, in a couple cases, science derived super powers. The emotional crux of the scenes, whether jovial or tragic, still feels very relatable 
Let's go into a bit more detail about the episodic nature of the series. Cowboy Bebop is one of those shows that has a lot of ideas for its episodes and does them all really well. There isn't a single episode that I can point to and say “that one wasn't very good.” There's not even one I can point to and say “that one was just good, not great but good.” Then again, this was written by Nobumoto Keiko, who also wrote Wolf's Rain & worked on the script for Tokyo Godfathers. The series also has some interesting, subtle things that are symbolically important. Including Spike's heterochromia which gets brought up fairly early and comes into play for the finale. Incidentally, the finale is absolutely phenomenal. I also really like the way the series does chase sequences. They can be kind of absurd but they hit that sweet spot where they have just the right levels of absurdity & intensity to be amazing.
Characters:
Let's begin our discussion with the most divisive character in the series, Edward. There are quite a few people in the fan base who don't much care for her because she's a bit childish, weird & generally a high energy “space case.” And you're probably thinking I'm one of those since I don't like children in general but I actually like her quite a bit. I find her to be a pretty delightful character. And I appreciate that she has complexity to her. There are elements to her back story that explain why she is the way she is and she is, in many ways, a prodigy but in others she acts her age. There aren't a lot of child prodigy characters who are still allowed to be children. They're usually shown as prodigies by being far more mature than anyone their age should be. So, I can appreciate this kind of take on it. 
The rest of the characters get similar treatment. They have very well developed back stories that you get glimpses of in various missions, eventually having them come into the spotlight for big character moments. These past events also explain a lot of the stranger facets of their personalities and they do have complex, developed personalties. And it's not just the major characters who are multi-faceted & compelling. The major characters they encounter in various missions get the same kind of treatment. To a lesser extent, for obvious reasons but they are brilliantly written characters. 
Art:
I know I'd normally criticise the fan-service outfits, but I can't really in this case. See, they do play up Faye's sexiness a bit with her outfit and such, but they do it in ways that actually suit her character and they do show restraint even in the most risqué scenes. So, I can't really complain about it. Because Faye isn't a practical minded woman so you don't really expect her to dress in practical attire. It's not often I encounter a series that manages to have fan-service elements but makes them work and shows class with them. 
The backgrounds and sci-fi dressings are fantastic. The action sequences, particularly in the last episode are phenomenal and the character designs are memorable for all the right reasons. And Ein is absolutely adorable. I want to pat his furry little head. 
Sound:
If a certain other popular sci-fi series gave us Hayashibara Megumi's worst performance, this easily gives us one of her best. And it's not just her. Tada Aoi, Yamadera Kouichi, Ishizuka Unshou, Wakamoto Norio and many, many actors for side characters are all fantastic in this. 
This series also has some of the best music I've heard in an anime. And not jut because the beats are thoroughly solid but because it's very good at using its incidental music to add that perfect final touch to any given action sequence. There are times where you're watching the action get started and the music kicks in at just the right time to elevate the scene beyond what it could possibly achieve with visuals alone. In fact, it happens a lot. 
Ho-yay:
There's a little bit. They encounter some gay guys during missions. I have to say, I appreciate that Spike's reaction to a man hitting on him is just an awkward disinterest in the dude. There are too many things that play up an exaggerated disgust in that kind of situation instead of having the character handle it like an adult. 
Final Thoughts:
Those of you who are familiar with my work know that I won't praise something solely because it's popular. In this case, I am going to join with the majority and sing the praises of this series. It's easily among the best science fiction works I've seen.. It just does everything really damn well and with very little room for improvement. For my final rating, I have to go with a full 10/10.

                I watched it because everyone said it is a masterpiece and must to watch but it ended up being disappointing. 
The overall anime is good and it had promise to be even better. In my point of view it had way too many pointless filler episodes and didn't really find good balance between being serious and laughable. I felt like the seriousness of the whole story was bit diminished by the fact that there were so many episodes just for laugh and giggles. 
I think that this anime would have been way better with a little bit more serious tone. It let me a bit
                  confused. Not bad anime by any means. Its just,,,I expected it to be bit better.",7,EternalWait92,

                If anyone ever asks what my favorite anime is I'll reply, ""Cowboy Bebop"" without a pause. Its the perfect blend of western and scifi with a hint of noir and any other genre they could manage to fit in there, all supported by some great music. 
Cowboy Bebop has great characters, rich stories, beautiful art, and some of the best music I've ever seen in an anime. The main plot is limited to a small portion of the 26 episodes leaving the other episodes to be largely self contained stories.In this way it is similar to other shows like Gintama that are structured primarily episodaly.
                  This allows the creators to experiment on every episode with a variety of genres and themes while exploring and developing characters and giving you glimpses of a beautiful and clearly very vast world. 
The episodal nature of the anime while being one of its greatest strengths is also its greatest weakness and a small number of episodes are definite misses especially when it comes to the quality of the rest of the anime. However, as these are all stand alone episodes these shortfalls don't detract from the rest of the anime and if you wanted to could easily be skipped.",10,guavaguy,

                What to say about this anime that hasn't already been said?
I finished CB not so long ago, and it quickly became my favorite anime so far, and for very good reasons. 
Story: 9/10
The storytelling in this anime is one of its crowning achievements. It follows the crew of the Bebop and their struggle to make a living out of bounty hunting, showing a different ""case"" in almost every episode. There's a criminal on the loose, they go out to get him, at some point things go wrong (no wonder there's a recurrent theme of luck/lack of luck in this show) and after all they've done
                  they either get a very small bounty, waste it all in one day, or get nothing at all. It sounds comical and even repetitive, but trust me, it's not. And that's because CB is a character-driven show - each of this ""cases"" serve to reveal a thing or two about the main characters, and how they deal with their past, which is, for most of them, pretty tragic. The ""main"" plot, however, is focused on Spike Spiegel, his forbidden romance, his downfall and his ascension. And it is beautifully done. It doesn't rely on clichés to get an emotional reaction out of you, it does not spoonfeed you with everything you need to know, it follows the ""show, don't tell"" rule to a tee... BUT exactly because of that it can also be a little slow in the beginning, so you have to be aware of that when you decide to watch it.
Characters: 9/10
The one word I can say to describe the characters in Cowboy Bebop is REAL. They look and feel real. My biggest surprise was Faye Valentine. At first she looks like a shallow woman who's willing to do anything to survive, but as the plot progresses and you get to know her past, you notice how complex she actually is. I was only a little disappointed with the lack of focus given to Ed, who could've been a little more developed, and Julia, who felt to me was just there to be Spike's love interest. Vicious, the main villain, also felt a bit cliché. Apart from that, most of the characters, including Spike, of course, are brilliant and very well developed. And I'm not talking only about the main characters. A lot of the side characters are also very interesting and memorable.
Art: 10/10
This anime was made in 1998, and it has better art than many anime from the 2010's. This is certainly something. The animation is incredibly fluid, the colors are spot on... I really have no complaints AT ALL in this area.
Sound: 10/10
CB's soundtrack is one of its most famous aspects, and rightly so. It's very unique and varied, with songs ranging from jazz to bossa nova (!). Yoko Kanno's score brings personality to a very music-oriented show, making an already memorable scene become even more memorable. I still listen to some of the songs in this soundtrack daily. That's how good it is. 
Enjoyment: 9/10
Like I mentioned before, Cowboy Bebop has a rather slow start. But it gets better, and even at its most ""boring"" moments, it has a level of intrigue that will make you come back to it and eventually enjoy it a lot. It's definitely a very rewatchable show, and it gives a lot of ""food for thought"" too. 
Overall, there's nothing else for me to say about this anime. It's a MASTERPIECE, in every sense of the word, and a definite must-watch for anime fans, and even for those who don't like anime. 
Cowboy Bebop is a 10/10!

                I will get heat for saying this is how I truly feel. Cowboy Bebop is good but overrated for me. First of all, the characters, artwork, music, sound effects were absolutely incredible and way ahead of it's time. SHOUT OUT TO THE THEME SONG!!!! But the story just didn't do it for me. The main villain I felt was not developed enough to make me care about him and it's because of this, the conflict between the protagonist and antagonist just didn't resonate. I will say the final episode was very well done and entertaining but in the end, I couldn't help but feel unsatisfied
                  by the whole show. I can't say in my right mind that I'd recommend it to everyone. For people who love episodic shows, this is as close to heaven as you can get. But for some that don't love that sort of format, I'd recommend to at least give it a shot as there is some high quality material to be found here. In the end, it was still an enjoyable experience and that's why I give it a 7.",7,Breakingbadfan69,

                I first watched Cowboy Bebop: Knocking on Heaven's door a couple years back and felt genuinely engaged throughout the movie and regretted that it had to end. I had absolutely no idea there was a fantastic piece of artwork in the form of an anime series behind this titular film. Ironically, as I watched Cowboy Bebop I found myself humbly involved with the series to the point that I would pause between episodes to really soak in this fantastic show. It is a genre in itself and never insists that it is. It is a fantastic chronicle of people experiencing an extraordinary lifestyle, but also
                  dealing with the normal challenges life brings. This series was dedicated to those special moments in your life when you say to yourself in the back of your mind ""this is worth it, this is me embracing the moment"". Of course these feelings are fleeting, which only makes them more cherishable, much like the brief run of this spectacular series.
The series takes place in the future. Earth has been plagued by freak technological accident and much of the population has expanded to the various planets in the solar system. Each planet is like a whole other world, which are slightly expanded upon during each adventure for the crew of the bebop. The bebop first has only Jet and Spike, bounty hunters looking for work only so they can fill their stomachs. Jet comes from a policing background, which has given him a reputation as the ""black dog"" who never releases his bite on a case. This gives him a sense of authority and father like actualities throughout the series. His partner, and the main character, Spike, comes from a mysterious past with ties to a crime syndicate known as the Red Dragon. He has since pulled out of the syndicate after realizing that it didn't make him ""alive"". He plans to be with his true love Julia, but circumstances arise between him and his long time rival Vicious, the only recurring antagonist of the series. As such, Jet and Spike get along well with one another since they are both trying to look ahead instead of behind. As they continue their journeys they meet various people during missions who seem to encapsulate various life experiences in their characters. Love, anguish, betrayal, obsession, loneliness, if only to name a few. Its as if the bounty is only the outer coating to much more involved lessons which are shown through the most subtle of gestures, much like in the real world, where it is hard to really know if something has impacted you until its over Jet and Spike soon meet Faye and Ed, two girls with mysterious pasts. Faye gradually learns of her past albeit at the end of the series at which point she lets down her guard to realize her true home is on the bebop. Ed presents herself as a zainy hacking genius, but she also has ties with her estranged father, which has caused her to wander frequently. WIth the ship's local canine Ein, Ed often makes ideas more clear to viewers through her childlike comedy by shouting them out is crazy ways. All four of these crew members embark on a series of encounters with various bounties. The story is moving on all levels, and remained the least bit contrived throughout, The great thing was the combination of most genres. There was not set plot or motif, which made all of the action and humor more engaging. The viewer is made to care about each exploit because they don't know what to expect on a structural level, but are still able to take tide and true knowledge with them after each stint.
The animation for the series was clearly defined and realistic, with each character being drawn in a way to reveal their personalities on a physical level. Jet is older, more experienced, with receding hair and armor to match. Spike is spontaneous and subtle at the same time, with wild hair and an ironically neat suit to match it. Faye is sexually involving but tough as nails. She is stubborn and selfish, enhanced by her look at me wardrobe. Ed's clothing is enhanced by her unpredictability. You don't really know what to think of her clothing since their it is so basic and childlike. This simplicity allows Ed to be more Astonishing. This pattern of art is seen throughout the character spectrum. All of the worlds are their own and match their tones. Just awesome.
The music for the series was absolutely insane. Each episode is known as a session and essentially the series is rooted from music itself. Every encounter has a soundtrack that enhances the feelings being portrayed in the episode. If its metal, its probably a tense situation, if its jazz, past regrets are being felt, if its classical, love is expressed. This coupled with the beautiful art only makes the story more impacting on a whole other level!??! The whole spectrum of this anime is seen with these combinations of sound and art! Also, each episode title refers to the type of music played throughout.
The characters in this series are the enjoyment factor. The crew of the bebop is so subtle with their affections that it seems like they've been a family for years. At times they don't even care about what the other is doing because it seems vindictive but the subtext is that they do care...so much so that they don't because they know thats just who the other person is. Its a whole other realm of trust that is so true in real life. Like I said earlier, if you couple the family crew of the bebop with influential characters on different worlds with their own messages, it makes it seem like the family learns something together, which makes the viewer learn something from four different angles. All of their actin and humor towards their bounty targets and eachother is hilarious and touching, and just pure entertainment.
I will never regret the time I spent watching, learning, and ultimately living from Cowboy Bebop.

                Cowboy Bebop is one of the few series that got recommended to me by both my real life friend and my net friends. I really wanted to like this show, I was so excited to watch this and my expectations were at an all time high which is what led me to dub cowboy bebop as the most disappointing anime ever
There are definitely worse, much worse series out there of course but I never expected much from them. Cowboy bebop however, is one of the most loved anime and everything I heard about it was positive which ultimately led me to expect Cowboy Bebop to
                  be an masterpiece that cannot be hated by anyone. Boy was I wrong
Well, that's enough of that, let's get on with my review
Story:
Cowboy Bebop is episodic for the most part and what's worse is that it's pretty much in the monster of the week format. There are a lot of standalone episodes in the series that aren't really important but they tried to force it at the end. I didn't like most of the standalone episodes but I hated what they did at the end even more
Characters:
They were able to give the most of the main cast a believable back story which properly explained why they acted the way they did. Not much of Ed's past is revealed though like why she even knew how to hack and what motivates her to act the way she does. They could've inserted that anywhere given how much standalone episodes they have but they didn't
Art and Animation:
I don't really mind the art style but some of the scenes just took me out of the anime because of how terribly animated they were but this can be forgiven because this is a 90s anime. The animation for the wormholes in particular were absolutely nauseous 
Sound:
I'm not a fan of Jazz so I have nothing to say about the music
Enjoyment:
This is one of the few anime where I actually had to push myself just to finish. I usually just drop them but given how highly acclaimed the series I held on unto hope that maybe, just maybe the next episode would be better and it wouldn't bore me out of my mind but no, that didn't happen and when I finished this series, I was just glad that it was finally over and I can finally watch something that I actually like. This series was boring from start to finish, the only exception being episode 8, the sole episode that I like
Overall:
It's not as good as people make it out to be and it failed to live up to my expectations but most importantly, and when I say most importantly, I mean that this is the only part that matters for me, it was boring and I didn't enjoy it which is why I'm going to give this a 6. 
Oh hey I just checked but my overall score for Cowboy Bebop is still a 6 if i take the average of my scores for it's separate aspects. 6.25 if I didn't count my score for the music (I divided it by 4 ofc, I'm not that dumb)
I don't think numbers can properly convey how much you like or dislike a show so take this sentence as my rating:
It still had some bits that I enjoyed but it was really boring as a whole. 
P.S. This is ofc just my opinion so don't send me death threats for this, okay? Cool?",6,KurosoraRyuga,

                Cowboy Bebop is a triumph of budget; a paper-thin anime with dynamic, fluid animation, a lovingly crafted eclectic soundtrack, and stylistic nuances for miles (one episode even effectively parodies blaxploitation). I don't mean that in an entirely derogatory way; it's really no surprise this is one of the major things that got people into Japanese animation, because it's an extremely fully realized show, so fully realized in fact that it's easy to overlook broad, undeveloped characters and a fanservice-vehicle female character who's dressed like a space hooker most of the time. There's not much to it, and yet there is.

                This was a tough watch for me, basically because I'm not into episodic storys and most of the episodes seemed like more or less good fillers. In the end i wished i only watched the 5 very enjoyable Vicious episodes and maybe the Jet and Faye background arcs. Especially episode 5 was a great 9/10.
The optics were mostly good except for the computer generated parts that was horribly upscaled for the bluray release, animation was superb and the soundtrack was a pleasant experience. I would recommend to watch only the 10 best rated episodes to make it not as protracted.

Cowboy Bebop has been praised by fans and critics as the greatest anime of all-time, it set a benchmark in the 90s for animation quality, has some of the best storytelling ever written and is one of the most influential anime ever. 
The show is episodic by nature but has enough backstory in each character to give an over arching view. Focusing in on the Bebop crew and their not so successful bounty hunting adventures Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed make up four of the greatest anime characters ever. They each bring something amazing to the show. Ed the super hacker adds a light hearted
                  element to the show that never seems to slow down or hurt the show in any way like so many other comic relief characters do, Jet the ex cop turned bounty hunter is kind of the father figure in the group, Faye the lovable gambling addict from the past who acts as a counter part to Spike and Spike... oh Spike, probably the coolest anime character ever, how do you not love this guy? he fights like Bruce Lee, has an amazing shot, has a dope backstory, is a total badass and has said some of the most icon quotes in anime history.
The animation is some of the best I've ever seen, backgrounds are detailed, the characters designs are all very unique, the fights flow like water and oh ya this is all hand drawn animation! no cheep tricks or cutting corners every frame of this show is absolutely flawless. The soundtrack on it's own is nice but coupled with the show is like the best anime soundtrack ever.it reminds me of Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece Taxi Driver in how the music seems to fuse so well with the visuals to give the viewer a one of a kind experience. 
Overall Cowboy Bebop is one of the greatest shows ever (anime or not), it has aged like scotch and is a must see for any and every anime fan. Until next time, see you space cowboy",10,Vorosh,

                My First Review ever so bare with me
Well I'm not even going to sugarcoat the fact that Cowboy Bebop was a big letdown for me. I was expecting so much from this series due to everyone hyping it up. But, I was left with underdeveloped characters, beyond idiotic actions from characters, and no one listening to Jet.... EVER. Despite all of this, there were some redeeming factors to this animes such as the music, funny scenarios, and just overall enjoyment.
Story:7
This shows all about the realtionship of a crew consisting of Spike, Ed, Jet, Faye, and little ole' Ein. Just a couple of ""bounty hunters"" (and
                  a dog) going from bounty to bounty, and how their pasts sort of catches up with them. Nothing special here really, It's whatever.
Art:8
I'm going to say this first off, I'm not the best judge when it comes to things such as art and animation but there were no problems with either of those in this anime. Pretty solid overall in my opinion.
Sound:10
This would be the entire anime's strongpoint in my opinion. The names of the episodes would be based off of genres, songs, and albums (ex: Asteroid Blues & Ballad of the Fallen Angels) and the music in each episodes sorta correlates to name of the episodes. The soundtrack mainly consists of Jazz and Blues music. These songs/insturmentals always added to the scenes and made them better than they actually were. A fight scene was turned into an AMAZING scene and a sad scene turned into a HEART-WRENCHINGLY SAD SCENE. The music was what made me keep watching this anime.
Character:6
Now his was the weak point of the anime for me. There were so many times where I wanted to know more about the characters like Ed or Ein, or Jet. There was literally no info given about Ed and Ein, they got no love. They were there to lighten up the series yet I know nothing about them. Jet was like the overprotective father of the group and I like that, but NO ONE AND I MEAN NO ONE EVER LISTENED TO HIM. Dang it as so annoying, like there would be CLEAR danger in their way and Jet would give some sound advice but all Faye and Spike wanted to do was die with a bang like HOLY. And Spike was EXTREMELY irrational and idiotic  to the point where it was eye aching. The reason for his innjuries 100% of the time was because he just went on his stupidity, no not instict, but stupidity. His character was cool at first but after a while he reminded me of a rebelious teenager who's overdramatic. Faye was alright, her back story was kinda sad but they explained so quickly I had to deep connection with her. Then there's Jet, not much too say really. He gets one episode of backstory for himself and done. We do get a LITTLE and when I say little i mean minuscule insight from other episodes about his past life, but again that's it.
Enjoyment:8 
Now even though the characters pissed me off, they did have their badass moments. Especially with his knack to use the environment to his advantage and his smooth fighting style. The funny moments with Ein and Ed were also a nice addition. Again, those moments really lightened up the show when it was getting depressing and dark. Also the conversations between people were also pretty hilarious to say the least
Overall: 7.5
Although I did get irritated at A LOT of moments in Cowboy Bebop it was still fairly enjoyable. The music also stepped the anime up a notch on my scale because of how good it was at enhancing the scene rather than take you away from it or kill it entirely. There no problems with art and animation either. In my opinion, this show doesn't live up to the hype in the slightest, It was underwhelming throughout the entire series in my opinion. Although, that ending was pretty sad. If you want to go watch this classic, go ahead, just don't go in with high expectations. REMEMBER NO OF THIS IS FACT, IT'S ALL MY OPINION.
P.S. I may have been a little nit picky with this anime but it was because I actually wanted to look at all aspects of the anime while watching it instead of just blindly watching it and giving it a 10 without knowing exactly what I enjoyed/disliked.",7,InfiniteJam,

                ""Whatever your past, you still have a future.""
One of the main characters Spike, says this in a particular episode of this series. This line stayed with me throughout the rest of the series & resonated during certain episodes. Eventually, this line formed what I thought was the big question that forms the plot of this of the show: Can you truly feel alive and have a future if you are constantly reminded of the past and how corrupted the world maybe you yourself are?
This question surrounds the main characters (Spike, Lee, Faye, and Edward) and some secondary characters they meet as they travel the galaxy
                  hunting criminals with bounties on a ship called The Bebop. Each main character has interesting personalties and mysterious pasts that gradually get revealed as the series goes on.
Spike is a tough, aloof guy with impulsive tendencies who can handle a gun, pilot a ship, and do martial arts. He is also empathetic in toward others in a big brother kind-of way. Jet is a pilot and mechanic who equally tough with guns, level headed (rarely impulsive) and empathetic in a fatherly way. Faye is a woman who is frivolous with money, has avoidance tendencies, and can handle a gun and won't hesitate to use her feminine charms to make other men drop their guard. Last but not least, Ed is an androgynous and energetic genius hacker who is very free-spirited and child-like.
As for the secondary characters, many are notable because they either serve as commentary on the real world in and/or they are sympathetic. One example is an animal rights group that threatens to turn people into monkeys unless they stop hunting a certain animal. Another notable aspect of the secondary characters is that they are diverse in body, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, and personality. The depiction of gay and intersex people in this anime is really progressive when you consider that the anime was made in the late 90's. Also, the way many dark-skinned characters are sprinkled throughout the anime is nice too b/c they are rarely seen in anime. 
Besides the plot and characters, the world building is really creative because it mixes several genres including spaghetti westerns, sci-fi, noir, and in one episode slasher films. This created the major themes of the anime (nostalgia and freedom) and makes you want to keep watching to see what the characters will encounter next.
In addition to the plot, characters, and world building, the soundtrack is incredible. Composed by Yoko Kanno, the soundtrack is rooted in jazz (specifically bebop jazz), but also features other genres like heavy metal and a dash of J-Pop. The fast-paced upbeat bebop jazz really compliments action scenes well. Furthermore, the opening title theme & its visuals are truly striking and memorable.
Last but not least, the animation is really beautiful at times and not so beautiful at others. The beautiful moments  are focused on the sky, like in one scene where Spike is smoking while watching the sunset. The not-so-beautiful moments come during the jump to hyperspace.
Overall, this was a really entertaining and enjoyable anime. If you are interested in sci-fi or saw Samurai Champloo first like I did & enjoyed it, then give this anime a try.",10,BlerdGirl,

                I normally don't write reviews until I've fully finished watching a show, and if my opinion changes at all, I'll update the review, but I have a lot to talk about as I find this specific anime - or rather the culture behind it - particularly fascinating.
This anime is touted as a classic, and is said by many to be the greatest anime of all time. And whilst I can see why people would think that, I personally feel so indifferent towards the show.
I have issue finding things I legitimately dislike about it beyond ""it's a product of its time and hasn't aged well and
                  there's shows since that, in my opinion, have done similar things to what Cowboy Bebop does, but done them better"", because I love the art, I love the soundtrack, and I love the characters.
My only issue with Cowboy Bebop which is entirely irrelevant of its age, derives from it being an aesthetically driven show that relies on the subtleties and connotations of its aesthetics and scenery rather than actual quality storytelling per episode. So it has the whole ""space western"" aesthetic down to a T, and the characters are also great, but I'm not a fan of its style of storytelling. I'm not exactly expecting an epic from a show that's mostly episodic with only a few references to previous episodes, but I often find it confusing and sometimes straight up pretentious with how visual its storytelling tries to be. It doesn't really leave me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what happens next, though whilst this is partially due to me not liking the stylistic writing choices, I don't really feel that's what this show was going for either. For me personally, if you can't write your show in a way that grips me and makes me really want to find out what happens at the end of the episode, or next episode, then I'll lose interest fairly fast.
Back to the whole ""it's a product of its time"" argument, however. I feel it's in Ocarina of Time, Half Life and Final Fantasy 7 territory, when you compare it to video games because of that. It's regarded so highly because for its time it would've been groundbreaking but nowadays it's just... I mean, it's enjoyable. There's some parts of this anime that were so ahead of its time, especially in terms of aesthetics, the fusion of futuritistic and antiquated scenery, and use of Western tropes. It also, given its age, has fairly decent LGBT representation, which is rare for anime nowadays, even.
The thing is, we're in 2018 now and there's been so many Japanese shows since that have given their take on Western tropes, that it just doesn't hold up when you separate it from its roots and its place as a piece of anime history. You can't entirely separate the show from its roots, however, because of how much it influenced its successors. This leaves me in an awkward position where as a standalone anime, I don't particularly care for it either way, but I have to also look at it in the grand scheme of things.
This led me down the path of realising that I probably would've liked this show a lot more if I'd have watched it, say 10 years ago when I was growing up. I'd have had less to compare it to back then. Then I remembered I said something similar in my Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt review, and it was at that point that it hit me that the point in which you consume a piece of media, not just in terms of your age, but in terms of the actual point in time, affects your judgement on said media. This can really sway how you perceive things. I think this was the major issue I had with Cowboy Bebop, and this is why I say it really is a product of its time, which to me personally, has not aged particularly well.
I'd last of all like to add, however, I'm not really the target demographic of this show, being a woman in my 20s. If I was a young adult man, finding myself and growing up, I feel this show would've done a lot more for me and generally been more interesting.",6,FactoriesFarAway,

""I'm not going there to die. I'm going to see if I'm alive"" - Spike Spiegel.
I don't know if you are aware of what you are living now. You were born to see masterpieces like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Steins;Gate, Neon Genesis Evangelion... You are lucky enough to enjoy your life, your hobbies without any kind of problem, to get yourself wrapped by different stories or characters. You are lucky enough to exist in the same timeline as Cowboy Bebop, the BEST anime ever created. You think you can argue on this? Well, you CAN'T.
90s were a strange time for anime. We had
                  experiments like Neon Genesis Evangelion, a mecha deconstruction. We had Serial Experiments Lain, a pioneer in the internet design. We had Revolutionary Girl Utena, Trigun... In 1998, Sunrise hired director Watanabe Shinichiro to direct an anime. They didn't care what that anime was about. They wanted something that was interesting enough to sell some figures. So, Shinichiro Watanabe, well known today for mixing samurais and hip-hop as well, mixed Cowboys, Jazz and space. What a shitty combination! Don't you think? You're totally wrong. After three or four episodes, Cowboy Bebop was delayed to late-night and there, he gained popularity, until becoming what is known to be the 'anime for adults' for excellence.
Cowboy Bebop does not have a normal story. To be fair, I'd say that Cowboy Bebop has multiple stories, because every single chapter is like having a new one in our heads. Basically, bounty-hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black travel in their ship, the Bebop, hunting criminals for money. From there, they know femme-fatale Faye Valentine and super-hacker Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, or as we know it, Ed. As a single crew, with their personal diferences but as a team, they do their jobs. Every character has a development arc, but most important is Spike's one. He, as an ex-member of a criminal syndicate called the Red Dragon, has to deal with his past. Not only does Cowboy Bebop has amazing individual chapters but also has the BEST ending I've ever seen in an anime.
The animation and character design are GORGEUS. Every fight, every new character we meet, every scenario, are specially designed to fulfill our desires. Explosions, flights, races and every single frame on this work is absolutely outstanding, to the point that I am still waiting to be as impressed as I am with Cowboy Bebop (TV show) in animation.
The sound is one of the most important parts in the series, because of the sensation it gives to the viewer. Bebop has that jazzy design on purpose, and Yoko Kanno, with The Seatbelts, make possible that immersion.
Cowboy Bebop is a metaphor to let your past behind you and keep going with your actual life, and the characters are always trying to remember us that the future is what matters. Do not let your past to haunt you like a ghost, forget about it and keep going. Or face it, in order to put a limit in your back. 
We have ex-police officer Jet Black, who can not forget about his past love, or about the arm he lost. Jet is a really nice guy that always pay his debts and wants to be in good terms with everyone. He cares about the crew like if they were his family and wants them by his side. Jet is always trying to get away of his past, but he keeps things in order to not forget about it (the watch his ex left him or the robotic arm he could have fixed).
We also have Faye Valentine, a cryogenized woman that has tons of debts. Faye is always running from her past, she wants to remember but it is afraid of what that memories can bring back. Despite her cold-blooded attitude, she deeply cares for the crew, even if it is to build a place where she can be part of.
Ed is the youngest member of the crew. With a positive attitude towards life, she is always searching for new things to do and learn. She has not any kind of past, but she has the role of showing us how you must enjoy every single moment of your life (while you can).
And finally, the all-time favourite Spike Spiegel. Listen, I love Spike. He's handsome, freaking cool and an awesome person. Despite those obviously positive attributes, he's such a hypocrite. He's always talking about how the past will bury you, but he does not talk about how his own past has buried him to the point that he can't look to the future without looking to the past.
I made this review because I recently ended the series for the second time and I can not believe how much I loved it and enjoyed this rush. Cowboy Bebop will forever be a personal favourite of mine.
So, even if you don't want to carry this weight, even if you don't think you are living in the real world, even if you think that if ""easy come, easy go"", if you don't have a comrade or if you are an sleeping beast, you can not die without watching Cowboy Bebop at least once.

                Cowboy Bebop is the result of a perfectly mixed drink. On the surface, it’s a futuristic space western about a ragtag group of bounty hunters during their adventures and misadventures. If you take a closer look, however, you will see sprinkled throughout a perfect mix of genres: dashes of horror, comedy, crime, romance, tragedy, philosophy, action, and parody all combined into one neat package. Each episode is a little different from the others by following the same cast of characters from all facets and angles. With each unique episode comes its own strain of music; from tribal drums and chants to electronic pulses. And yet
                  each song and episode somehow always fills you with the emotions that come with its namesake: bebop, blues and jazz. Despite airing around 15 years ago, Cowboy Bebop has continued to hold its place as one of the greatest anime shows ever to be created, a fact cemented by its vast array of awards and the legacy that followed in its wake. 
	The brew that is Cowboy Bebop gets is aroma and flavor from its cast of characters. At first glance, they are a strange group of characters that are only in bounty hunting for the quick cash so they can eat. As the series progresses, the characters are slowly revealed and their intentions known. You first think Spike to be a slacker who does the bare minimum on the job, only to learn later of his past in the criminal underground and the loss that killed him emotionally. Jet is the gruff authority figure until you realize he cares deeply for the crew as family. Faye is your typical wild and free female lead but only because her deep set tragic background has forced her to push away any sort of relationship. Ed is an amazing hacker prodigy who has no rhyme or reason until you learn of her past and deprived childhood. The diverse casting, build up, and execution provides a strong set of personalities that the viewer is easily able to get behind and root for.
	This blend of a show solidifies itself a diverse soundtrack and fluid animation, even by today’s standards. Each of the 26 episodes have a certain spunk to them, whether they be comedy or tragedy. Some argue that one season’s worth is hardly enough to really flesh out what this series could have been. While this may be true, this series does a splendid job of mixing itself into one strong, dynamic, and satisfying experience that caps itself off just at the peak of its ability.",10,Zokalo,

                As a guy who only recently started having real interest in anime I've tried to create a list of very good animes to start my anime quest and set a good standard, and Cowboy Bebop is certainly one that will be remembered by me for many years to come. 
Nobody I knew watched it, I had no idea of what to expect, except for a good soundtrack, and it was all a new experience to me. I'm usually more interested in fantasy stuff, with superpowers or supernatural beings, but I certainly did not miss that while watching Cowboy Bobop. 
At first glance Spike was the
                  skinny guy with weird hair who tried to look cool and just looked bored most of the time and Jet was the strong guy who had to make up for his partner's laziness and do most of the thinking, but this was not the case. As the seemingly completely disconnected episodes pass, we get to see much more of their pasts and what led them to become what they are now, and it does not happen over 1 or 2 episodes and bam, you know eveything, it builds up from episode to episode, finding out bit by bit about everyone's past. 
Faye Valentine and ""Radical"" Ed are the other 2 members of the Bebop's 4 people crew (not forgetting about the lovely dog named Ein). Faye is a woman that can really take care of herself (most of the times) and has an easy time losing all her money through bad gambling or being held at gunpoint by strange people. Ed is a really weird girl who happens to work much better with her computer than with people, but she is an interesting character whose naivety and disconnection with the situations actually play for her. 
I personally liked the second part of the 26 episodes more. Perhaps it took a few episodes for the characters to build on me? The combination of excellent jazzy soundtrack with unexpected situations and people you don't know very well engaging in unique bounty hunting from episode to episode on different places of the solar system is something you will probably love or hate. I loved it, and the last episode surely made me shed one manly tear (okay, 2 tears).",10,CuriousButton,

                As a fairly new anime fan I obviously started with some of the most recommnded shows, and Cowboy Bebop was one of the first. This show is considered a masterpiece thanks to the alleged fascinating characters, outstanding story and amazing music. 
Let's start with the latter- the Jazz soundtrack is really cool, though not notable or memorable in most of the parts. The openening theme is super cool, and I almost never skipped it (a thing I usually do). 
The show has a nice background story- after an accident in the hyperspace the Earth became uninhabitable, and humanity colonized the other planets and moons of
                  the solar system. Meanwhile, crime rates have risen, and bounty hunters help the police catch criminals. In short- a fair setting for a space western. There are indeed some beautiful views and space battle scenes in here. 
The problems begin when the story starts being told. First, like most in of the shows in which the episodes' plots aren't tightly connected, troubles tend to get fixed to quickly. A more major problem is that the first 10 episodes are absolutely boring! If the show wasn't considered a must-watch classic that luckily has only one season, I probably wouldn't have gone past them. The 11th episode is a turning point in the manner of the plot quality, altough such episode was probably made in every show with a spaceship ever. 
But eventually, the biggest cause for my personal relative unenjoyment was the thing that the show is most praised for- the characters. It is true that all the main characters have mysterious troubled pasts that are explored throughout the show. However, because we know nothing of them at the beginning of the show, and their backstories are revealed way to slowly, I couldn't find even a small piece of interest in any of the characters until the very last episodes. For example, Jet's past which was the first to be revealed, is actually quite an uninteresting unoriginal cliche. Around episode 20 I realized that my favorite character is actually Ein the dog! Combining that with the boring first 10 episodes, I got a show that I would likely drop in an early stae unless I was feeling obligated to watch it until the end as a so called classic. 
Also, I was really bothered by the unproportional bodies of Spike and Faye, or more specifically- their extermely long legs.",6,Avner45,

                Cowboy Bebop sets the bar. I take that back; it's nonsense to set the best as a standard. Not only does it put many others in its genre to shame, but many Hollywood productions should also cower in fear of this magnificent masterpiece.
Bebop's episodic nature is exemplary of what artists can do with anime. It has story arcs, but it also has independent episodes like the throwback to Alien and the terrifying one about Pierrot Le Fou. This flexibility allowed its artists to explore a wide variety of themes while maintaining consistency. The storycraft occasionally walks a fine line between detail and ambiguity at times,
                  much like film noir of old, but it never feels muddled. From the iconic Swordfish spaceship to the space casinos, the cyberpunk and ""used universe"" atmosphere is realized by the art, which really brings the believable near-future world to life. 
Furthermore, Watanabe's direction is truly masterful; each episode feels complete and whole, and the series has great pacing as well. Watanabe also provided brilliant direction to action sequences, with fights paying homage to Bruce Lee and breathtaking chase scenes.
Great characters are essential to a character-driven plot, and Cowboy Bebop shines in this regard. The series features amazing characters that build on archetypes with their own twists. Their backstories work in tandem with the archetypes, which makes them all the more memorable and not mere caricatures. Character interactions are relatable and meaningful, always with genuine chemistry. 
The series' music deserves a special section all of its own. Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts really made a timeless hit with every single song they wrote for Bebop. The soundtrack prominently features jazz such as the iconic OP ""Tank!"" but also slow-paced blues and even pop music. It is difficult to write about music, as preferences in thus is such a basic if not primal sensation. The most I can say is that if you like jazz and blues, you will fall in love with the soundtrack immediately; if not, you really might start liking these genres.
This series had the gall to include the line ""and the work which has become a genre unto itself shall be called: Cowboy Bebop"" in the OP. The nerve of them to do that...and yet I find myself wholeheartedly agreeing with them. Cowboy Bebop is the ultimate combination of a great storyline, endearing characters, amazing music, and you will never watch anything quite like it. This is undoubtedly a classic, and my favorite anime series of all time.",10,enderx30,

The antics of the main characters are hilarious but underneath their humerous appearance lay hidden secrets and sad pasts. Like most anime, it has it's action scenes and love scenes. It's worth watching if you can get past a few of the not so exciting episodes. But like I said, there's only a few that the series could do without. In the end howevere, it's worth

                Cowboy Bebop, is a masterpiece. Anybody who argues otherwise quite obviously doesn't understand the medium. Cowboy bebop is one of the few shows out there that exists so highly in so many people's lists that it has become like a reference point all other anime is graded out of.

*Person 2* Hmm, how many Bebops out of 10 was it?
*Person 1* Eh, 2-3.
*Person 2* This analogy is getting old!
But I think you understand what I mean.
Let me start with the story, a lot of people could argue that CB is just a bunch of filler, and
                  while they might technically be right, all the filler there serves the purpose of supplying character development which makes the story make sense. It all ties in and that is wonderful.
Art? Pfft, more like heaven's gloriously profound image of god we just found lying around on Toonami one day.
Sound?
2 words, Yoko Kanno.
Done. 
NEXT!
Character development as I stated earlier is an integral element of this, as is Yoko Kanno's stunningly jazzy soundtrack and this is one of the few anime out there that rivals NGE in terms of character depth an portrayal.
Character development is defined as
""the change a character undergoes during the course of a story""
And in most stories this would apply to character that goes from point A (Us knowing nothing about them) to point B (Us knowing something about them)
But in Bebop they handle it a bit... Smoother, because there are no time stamps at which we know more about them per se.
I will just say, like Spike's famous fighting style... It's smooth like water.
The enjoyment is so far through the roof I can see the toys in the attic, it's just a fun show.
Overall Bebop is an absolute masterpiece that needs to be seen by anybody and everybody, even people who don't like anime.
Watch it and enjoy, it's a wild ride.

                How can I possibly review ""Cowboy Bebop""? The show has been reviewed, and re-reviewed, and talked about, and taken apart, been overrated, underrated, and just done to death that at this point my words would make about as much difference as if I were to drop a lit match onto the surface of the sun. But, maybe my words will read and maybe you the reader will be aided by them. 
The word I can use to describe this Anime best is cool. From the characters, to the artwork, to the soundtrack, to the dialogue. It's a smooth, fun, futuristic ride through this 26-episode series.
                  Most episodes are stand alone with a few two part ones that deal with the big picture plot of the series. It has a massive tech-noir flavor, futuristic settings that are fogged by clouds of cigarette smoke and a jazz melody in the background. I hope the future is this cool. 
The characters in this show are unforgettable and grow on you very quickly. Spike Spiegel, the mellow martial arts bounty hunter with a mysterious past. Jet Black, the grizzled ex-cop with a cybernetic arm who enjoys gardening. Faye Valentine, the grifting femme fatale who always ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Ed, the little girl with a boys name who is a total genius and total goof, and Ein the Dog. He does dog stuff.  
Now, don't go into this show expecting to be blown away. The amount of praise this show gets makes it sound like it will change your life, lower your taxes, and improve your gas mileage. It's a great show. A masterpiece. But step back, take a deep breath, and watch one episode at a time when you can. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Don't binge. I find this is best way to enjoy the show. Sub vs. Dub is a surprising big win for the dub. Steve Blum, Wendee Lee, Beau Billingslea, and Melissa Fahn as Spike, Faye, Jet, and Ed play their parts to perfection and set the gold standard for every English dub before or since. If all English casts were as good as this, subtitles would not be necessary.
I hope this review has helped you out and I thank you for taking the time to read it. Please enjoy ""Cowboy Bebop"" as much as I did. It's a great show. And a must-see for any Anime fan. 10/10. Check it out. Cheers!",10,GarlandReese,

                I think Cowboy Bebop is overrated. OK now fans of the 90's with your torches and pitchforks calm down and let me have my own opinion. personally, while I do see why people love this anime I think they're reading too much into it and worse, some of them overhype it to such a degree that other better anime in my opinion suffer from unjust criticism. Note that if you like it a lot, fine I respect your opinion, I really do, nor do I think less of anyone who does. Just don't call me immature just because I don't like it because, I am
                  NOT an idiot. OK?
Now why didn't I like it? I can't simply list the stuff I liked and didn't like so I'll review the show as a whole. Everyone says that they like it for the characters, animations, simple plot and the narrative which is supposed to be subtle and leaves a lot to the imagination of the viewer.
Animation is very, very good and the action is some of the greatest (well, most of the time. The 'fight' in episode 19 sucked) and the soundtrack, with or without the way it was used is one of the greatest ever. Favorite tracks include Blue, Call me Call me, The Real Folk Blues, Ask DNA and of course Tank!
Before I talk about the plot, let me talk about the characters. Spike and Faye are without a doubt the most interesting characters in the whole show. Faye herself starts off as a 'femme fatale' character that dislikes men and tries manipulating them for her own wants. We later see what gave her this mind set and her back-story was believable and rather tragic, so much so I actually did feel sorry for her. She does develop a lot through what I deem intense suffering and I like how she gets a crush o Spike. Speaking of Spike, he's also a complex character, one who is fairly sympathetic and compelling. Despite being really lazy and only cares about food and playing pool because he believes life is nothing but a dream, he still searches for and loves his missing girlfriend. OK, so far so good but Spike has a really grating flaw of being very reckless and wild when chasing his bounty. We've seen him engage in dogfights with a lot of his bounty whilst being inside a populated city too many times to count. Because of this, the show states, a lot of the bounty they do get ends up being used to pay for property damage. Oi, writers, what about the hundreds of people Spike accidently massacred? To make this worse, some of the people he is chasing aren't necessarily a threat like Jet's ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend Rint. I mean dude, they were on a cheap boat, stop trying to kill them just because you’re hungry. Geez.
Jet while still complex has a really clichéd back-story and I didn't care much for his character whilst Ed is Ed; she's funny and can even be cute but that’s about it. She doesn't have that much depth as a character. Vicious was an interesting and effective villain though. I actually did want to know more about him and his plans and motivations are actually interesting. The same cannot be said for most of the other villains. Pierrot le Fou as I said was a boring character and his back-story is also really clichéd. I mean come on, how many time have we seen a villain who becomes evil because of torture before? How many villains also have an amusement park of doom as their secret hideout? And is it me or did episode 20 of Bebop have much more fluid animation than usual?
Now, you'll tell me that Bebop's main appeal isn't the plot so much as the characters who themselves are supposed to be everyday type of people; you'll tell me that Bebop is more about the experience, that it wanted people to feel rather than give them a normal 3 (or 4) act story. Note I love works of fiction that are supposed to be more of an experience and don't necessarily have a plot and I also love different characters. Sadly, I didn't find the world of Bebop or the premise that interesting. I didn't care for the characters that much, I didn't care for the world and I also didn't experience anything from Bebop's story that other anime have given me. The only time I can say I actually felt anything was in episode 24 with the scene where the song Call me plays. I actually did cry at that scene but that’s it. The rest of the series didn't give me anything that would make me feel sad, angry, sick, happy or anything. Yeah, do you remember that scene in episode 26 where a friend of the protagonist dies? Yeah, I didn't cry because I did not care.
They say that Bebop's narrative style relies not only on the music but also on the lack of back-story, letting people draw up their own conclusions. Draw up conclusions to what? What motivates the characters to act like they do? I guess it did work pretty well sometimes but not all of the time and this is another major flaw I found with Bebop. I didn't care for most of characters because I didn't know a lot about them and what I knew were too vague. In a work of fiction you can't build off a character based on mere hints: we must have a reason to care and the only character I really cared for was Faye as her back-story wasn't clichéd in the least and she was actually interesting. 
Even Spike who is an interesting character on his own suffered from me not caring because I didn't get his mindset. What made him believe that life is just a dream? What made him give up on life? What DO Spike and Julia see in each other? No, scratch that, somebody tell me what is so interesting about Julia because other than being Spike's girlfriend and one who cares for him a lot, I don't know much about her. I don't know what Spike sees in her, how they got off and developed their relationship and when things start to take a turn for the worse for them, I found myself not caring because as I said, I didn't have a reason to care about this relationship. In other good anime and manga like Berserk, Rurouni Kenshin, Sankarea, Clannad etc... we actually see the main couple develop feelings for each other over time, so much so that when they do suffer it becomes all the more heartbreaking. Bebop, didn't show Spike and Julia developing. They just got it off (I guess) and pretended to leave their relationship to our imagination. Explain anime, explain!
With this thought process, am I to assume that Ed became the way she is because she had to roam the world because her father abandoned her? There are plenty of children who are homeless and yet aren't insane so what on earth drove Edward to become like that? Something more sinister maybe...
I also disagree with the line ''And the work which has become a genre unto itself shall be called: Cowboy Bebop.'' I find it pretentious and non-sensical because no matter how many genres it crammed into its 26 episodes, it didn't explore every genres strengths and devices and in the end it is and will always be a science fiction action show.
The absolute worst flaw Bebop has though is the lack of plot and character development and over reliance on filler episodes. The best episodes like Jupiter Jazz, The Real Folk Blues, Hard Luck Woman and of course, Ballad of Fallen angels all had character development or a new revelation about the most interesting characters namely, Spike and Faye. Most of the time though, the show was spent on the 'gang' either tracking a boring clichéd villain (like Pierrot le Fou and the Space eco-terrorists), not very funny comedy antics (Mushroom Samba, Cowboy Funk and Toys in the Attic) and sometimes, I found myself absolutely bored by the show with really pointless episodes (like Speak like a Child and the horrible Wild Horses).
Now, I'm someone whom likes good episodes that don't necessarily advance the plot but instead reveal more about the characters and the world they live in. Cry for the devil was very good and so was My Funny Valentine. Ganymede Elegy was a good episode showing more of Jets back-story and Gateway Shuffle was rather intense and atmospheric. Most of the other episodes weren't like that. My least favorite Bebop episode is Wild Horses: there wasn't an interesting fight scene, the characters introduced were very forgettable and we didn't find out more about the world of Bebop because the episode TOOK PLACE IN A FREAKING DESERT FULL OF UNINTERESTING SAND! The episode before it was just as bad because half of it is just Jet and Spike searching in vain for a VCR in order to play the mysterious video tape Faye received. Some people thought the entire struggle was funny: I thought the writers were too lazy and I don't want to pass through a boring episode like that just to get one sad moment that lasted 3 minutes. Someone told me that episode 19 was important in showing how Spike and Jet's relationship worked and again, I don't want to pass through a boring episode like that only to see two characters exchange a few lines and pretend that I'm seeing something deep.
I think I'd have given the series a much higher rating had it been shorter and most episodes having focused on the plot and character development because when it did focus on the plot, Bebop was amazing and without a doubt those episodes had the best moments and use of music. My final verdict for Bebop is a 7 for good. It's just an action show, a good action show but just an action show. It doesn't deserve a 10 because it's not that deep nor inspiring, nor do I think it  is the masterpiece most fans of the 90's think it is and no, Bebop fans, the worst of Bebop is NOT better than the best of anime. Period. There are plenty of anime that are vastly superior to Bebop in both characterization and writing. However, as I said, it's not horrible or downright bad and it does stay with you.",7,philipmarie,

                Story
Many times have I visited Cowboy Bebop, and every time we've parted company I leave with a sense of how great a conversationalist Cowboy Bebop truly is. How it tells beautiful stories with nothing but ink, paint, computers, and sound. How it seems to transcend it's own media and become something unto itself. Nothing to be worshiped or canonized, but to be viewed with a measure of respect, and perhaps awe, that such a thing ever took place at all.
Cowboy Bebop, that's the story. There are cowboys and there is bebop, set against the backdrop of the future and space. The series concerns itself with
                  the lives of Jet Black, Spike Spiegal, Faye Valentine, and Ed. The series itself tends to revolve around sorting out each characters past and reconciling it with their present selves. What sets Cowboy Bebop apart from similar series such as Outlaw Star is that these stories are actually interesting.
Animation
Animation directors strive for different goals. Some, like Hayou Miyazaki seek a balance between we humans and nature. The director of Ghost in the Shell, Mamoru Oshii forewarned us that advancement without restraint presented dillemas with no solutions. Shincihiro Wantanbe gave us, with Cowboy Bebop, twenty-six pictures of a world coming to terms with its past. The methods vary, with death, resignation, and an eyes wide shut attitude dominating. But never are these heady themes forced upon us with a heavy hand. They are at many times hidden behind sharp humor, attention to detail, and jaw dropping animation. Only two times are these themes truly brought to a head: at the twelfth and thirteenth episodes (parts one and two of Jupiter Jazz), and episodes twenty-five and twenty-six (parts one and two of The Real Folk Blues). And at these moments the music gets better, the animation sharper, and like true climactic moments, they stay with us long after we finish watching them.
For it's time, Cowboy Bebop was about as good as television animation got. The style was classically anime, big eyes no nose, small mouth. The fighting animation is very fluid and detailed. But what most impressed me about Cowboy Bebop's animation was the variety of locals, and the lived in natures of every environment that is visited. From the Bebop itself, with its endless rooms and corridors to variety of ethnic architecture, it is truly a treat to behold. The computer graphics are dated by today's standard, but for its time was cutting edge.
Sound
Never before or since has such a catalog of music been assembled for an anime, any anime. The principle creator of Cowboy Bebop's music, Yoko Kanno, took the high-road. She hopped from genre to genre in leaps and bounds while never taking from the animation itself, but infusing it with a pulse that at all times seemed perfect. Sometimes characters are defined through music, like Gren, whose sax playing pronounces him melancholy, disillusioned, and cavalier. Three original soundtracks were put together for this anime, each one is distinct and non-repetitious. Listening to them on their own gives you new appreciation on the quality of Yoko Kannos gift.
Characters
Characters from Cowboy Bebop each have stories to tell. Each deals with its past and present as best they can, although often times not very well at all. The plot is linear as far as the time line is concerned, but there isn't a penultimate goal sought after. In terms of the classic definitions of conflict, Cowboy Bebop tends towards the man versus himself, or man versus man types of conflict. The principles of Cowboy Bebop do not seek paradigm shifts, do not seek to change the world for the better or worse, but simply to live to see another day. This struggle to live on is what makes Cowboy Bebop so enjoyable, and what gives a humanity to the principle characters that they would otherwise lack.
Overall
The concept of Cowboy Bebop is not original, but its execution is outstanding. The characters are not original, but how they interact with the world around them is. The music can be defined by genre, but the impact on the individual cannot. The animation has been topped over the years, the cgi definitely shows its age, but there are still moments of raw beauty that are still unparalleled. Cowboy Bebop is not a rite of passage in anime fandom, but it should be a signpost, showing you the difference between the sublime and the ordinary.

                At 2071, Earth is not the only habitable planet in the Solar System. With the advent of hyperspace technology comes new rules, eras, laws, law-breakers and law-enforcers. Aboard the shuttle Bebop, bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black struggle, bounty after bounty, with unruly shipmates, mutated-lobsters and vengeful old-timers from the past, all while keeping the Bebop afloat.
My reasons as to why Cowboy Bebop is a must see:
1. Spike Spiegel
2. The Real Folk Blues soundtrack, and;
3. Session 5: the Ballad of the Fallen Angels
Cowboy Bebop is a straight-forward anime. Spanning 26 episodes called sessions, Cowboy Bebop boasts of great character designs, fluid animation, splendid voice
                  acting and one hell of a soundtrack.
Cowboy Bebop is synonymous with great music. Each session is entitled with reference to a musical concept or title, and each session is buoyed by the ever present tunes and strains of jazz and blues, composed by the great Yoko Kanno.
Animation-wise, the series has outstanding visuals all throughout its entire season. Movement and action are beautifully designed (most especially Spike's fight scenes using jeet kune do) and top-notch. Those who prefer the visuals over the everything else will not be disappointed.
Combine great visuals, with great music, plus great characters and great story, this is one anime every anime lover should watch (See how many greats I used in just one sentence??)
My only qualm with the series, a qualm that's quite insignificant, really, is the way the characters' backstory are never really fully explored. Conclusions and closures are, by turns, done during the first and last half of the season. Though all sessions are still enjoyable and comedic, it would have been nice if sessions devoted to the main characters story arcs were explored.
Still, Cowboy Bebop is one-giant step above other animes, one that should not be missed. Grab/borrow/rip/steal a copy and you've got yourself one big bounty",10,jassydroll,

                First review here, new to MAL, and maybe not read that much. But still, allow me to give my point.
At the time of watching Cowboy Bebop, I was watching animes since a lot of time, and I was watching many at the same time. The kind of period when you were following more than the half of the series in a season. Finally I got tired of that, and the enjoyment was not the same. And then I wanted to watch Cowboy Bebop.
Why is Cowboy Bebop such a great anime? Why is it considered as a masterpiece? I wanted to know, I wanted to be
                  part of it -if there was something to be a part of. But still, I couldn't forget Angel Beats. All my friends were telling me ""man, it's so awesome"". Well, check it out, it got only a 5 on my list. I'm not THE guy, but still, I was bored by this ""masterpiece"", or whatever my friends were telling me.
So what, I started Cowboy Bebop, let the magic do its stuff alright? So I was in. It's nice, I like it. I don't see any masterpiece here but hey, who cares, we'll see later. Oh the episode is already finished? Well, I played the second. And the third. And again and again. Watching the show wasn't that amazing. But I was so in it... When the last episode finished, I understood. I realized I watched something amazing. I haven't felt something like that since my first shots with series like Steins;Gate or Madoka.
Let me explain more: everything is just perfectly right, at the right time, with the right tempo and the best way to do it. It's not just something remarkable that you can point out, like SAO's first season is wonderful, but the ALO season is quite useless and really bad. Everything here is just fucking right (forgive me).
The story is wonderful, from the start to the end, including every background introduced. This is a point were old series can be boring, because the pace is slow, there are useless episodes. In Cowboy Bebop, forget it. Every episode is right, and the progression is really good. When you finish an episode, you sure want the next one. So it's a 10 I guess.
The sound is fantastic. Why? Because it's jazz and blues. What could be cooler than that? Seriously guys, the sound design is great, and the soundtrack is 20% cooler than any other. Go for it! And thank you Yoko, I love you.
The characters. Well, it goes with the story to me, mostly because each character has a good personnality, they understand each other, their interactions are right. They are deep, they smoke (oh my god they smoke it's so cool! I don't but it's so fucking cool!)... I don't know what to say, they're perfect! They just fit right in the global atmosphere of the show.
It's obviously an overall 10. No less. Because when you start Cowboy Bebop, you finish Cowboy Bebop. It's just amazing, and you have to realize it, at least when you finish it.",10,Jakedax,

                I thought I'd try writing a review for once, and also for an anime I have sort of complicated feelings on so here goes! 
I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop a lot more than most anime, so it was by no means unenjoyable. However, I never liked it as much as a lot of people and also by comparison to a lot of really popular anime so I'm going to try and pinpoint the reasons for that.. it's still a very entertaining anime though make no mistake!
Basically, it just comes down to not really being a big fan of the characters at times.. Spike is kind of
                  a bit easygoing for me, Jet is kind of a bit stiff, Ed is kind of too random, Faye is sort of greedy. 
Well ok, Faye is pretty cool, it's true, then Ed..  but overall I the biggest thing was that Cowboy Bebop kind of starts off insanely slow and is very, very cautious 
Now, that is, on the one hand, appealing! Certainly Cowboy Bebop is one of the more engaging anime for that reason, but when things often had a kind of filler-y approach for the most part. 
The story moves around a lot, basically Spike and Jet are perpetually out of $ because they keep almost failing to get so-and-so or such-and-such, as a consequence the anime is more about the banter and character experiences as much as the big mega moments involving old hatreds or new optimism or whatever it is. 
Like, ok, it's a unique blend of different worlds, it's fantastical, it's realistic, it's sensible and boisterious, it's a strong personality, it's Cowboy Bebop, but, the best? Hmm I mean consider there are lots of really engaging anime out there. 
Ok, lets make a deal, and put Cowboy Bebop up there, but the movie much more resonant in many ways, it incoporated the cool things about the anime and kind of squished it into something that didn't feel like it dragged as much. 
Overall, I can't say I hated Cowboy Bebop, it just felt like the experiences of emotional high were few and far and in between, thus, an 8 (ah screw it, I'll just give it a 9)",8,Kefka1134,
1,"
                Cowboy Bebop is an absolute classic. Most people would say this is 'the pinnacle of all anime shows'. While there are some aspects of the show I liked, to say that this is the BEST of the BEST seems a little far-fetched to me.
Cowboy Bebop is set in the distant future where space travel has been developed. Bounty hunters exist around the solar system to capture criminals and survive by being rewarded for their bounty. The story centres around 4 main characters - Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine and Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV (or Ed) and it tells us of their journeys
                  and struggles.
I'll get a lot of the repeated praises out of the way first, before people completely disregard the whole review for the issues I had with the show.
The animation is splendid - that, I simply cannot deny. For a 1998 anime, the quality definitely rivals the most up to date ones and still surpasses a vast majority of them. The movements of the characters and attention to detail in the backgrounds are so crisp clean, it is virtually eye candy for any viewer.
Another thing Cowboy Bebop succeeds in is the soundtrack. The opening song 'Tank!' is one of the most iconic tune in anime history and will be immediately recognised by most anime watchers. Although the opening song and background music aren't suited to my tastes (by that I mean I wouldn't listen to them on my MP3 player) it sets the mood perfectly for a lot of the scenes within the show. Another compliment goes to the ending theme song 'The real folk blues' which I frickin love (Now THAT is on my MP3 playlist).
As for the voice acting, both the English and Japanese voice actors/actresses have done a wonderful job bringing the characters to life. Their performances in their own respective languages has virtually no flaws. So if you ask me which language to watch it in, it would be - it doesn't matter, both are good, it really is up to you.
Now here's where I must be careful of what I say...
So why couldn't I enjoy this as much as the 99% of people who declare that this is the definition of masterpiece? I guess the main reason would be the episodic nature of the show. Of course this is subjective from person to person. I personally would have liked to see the characters have an overall goal where a satisfying conclusion is met rather than individual episodes with their own plots.
But that isn't where the real problem lies. A good show should have a great start which draws the viewer in, a strong central story where character development can take place and finally, it should have a memorable ending. Unfortunately, the first few episodes of Cowboy Bebop aren't that entertaining. It's average at best but nothing spectacular to draw the audience into the show, if anything pretty standard fair to introduce all the characters.
It picks up its pace and starts to get interesting when it reaches the episode 'Ballad of Fallen Angels' (episode 5). I don't want to spoil anything, but this is the first episode where the anime gets more serious. We learn a little about Spike's past and it starts to get more fascinating... BUT here's where I feel Cowboy Bebop fails at. The episode just ends. It side tracks to something else. The next episode is something completely different, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it feels that what I've just seen gets abandoned - tossed to the side. Any tension built up from the previous episode is just gone and this happens throughout the show and I get really irritated.
I want to know more, but it never gives me that satisfaction. It's like the series is about to show something interesting, but then completely forgets about it in .5 of a second. It would be okay if the episodes after the 'serious' ones were JUST AS fascinating. But this simply isn't the case. They are decent/fine at best and this contrast from watching something amazing to plain average constantly gives the feeling of disappointment. Now this doesn't make it a bad show. It just means the series is average to worth watching at best but nothing spectacular for it to be called a 'masterpiece'.
One more thing to add to the individual plots for the other episodes. It is either hit or miss in terms of how entertaining it is. There were some which I would have liked a continuation of, however, in most cases it just ends. It isn't a coincidence that the only episodes I genuinely enjoyed were the ones where they reveal a little about why the characters are the way they are now - a prime example would be Faye Valentines past. And as for the other episodes, I feel ""meh"" towards them.
Finally, for the ending... it's very good... I don't want to talk about it as it contains spoilers. All I can say is, it's a very fitting way to end the show. (yay! another compliment!)
Maybe I'm being too harsh in this review... hmm... okay... so if the story isn't a masterpiece, surely the characters should be able to 'carry' the series - so entertaining that simple actions by them make the whole show a masterpiece. Unfortunately, they aren't the most jaw dropping fascinating characters I've seen. Now before you shoot me down with a bazooka: allow me to explain; the main characters are very interesting but I feel that the show does nothing with them. I understand that Spike is supposed to be cool but the story doesn't do much to show that. Yes he is good looking, yes he has a sense of justice, yes he fights like a boss but... that seems like a stereotype to me. I would have liked to know more about his past, what did he suffer to become the way he is? Why is he so attached to Julia? These kind of questions pop-up not just for Spike but for the other main characters too. One possible reason for this could be Cowboy Bebop only has 26 episodes, it's quite difficult to explain everything in such a short time span.
Though the biggest problem for me was the supporting characters. I simply didn't give a damn about them. I wasn't particularly attached to them nor were they particularly memorable. Naturally for an episodic show like this, there are guaranteed to be characters which will be more interesting than others. The problem is, I felt no attachment to approximately 95% of the characters.
Let me give an example of one of the supporting characters, Vicious. He is the most interesting support character (in my opinion) and is supposedly the villain of the show but I can't help but question things like ""why is Vicious like this?"", ""why is he supposedly the villain?"", ""what are his motivations?"" It feels as though he's just there for us to 'agree' that he is a bad guy when there's no real reason for it. This is what I mean by the contrast of the serious episodes to the non-serious ones. I'm about to learn something from Vicious but the next episode just completely abandons the idea with the metaphorical 'episodic reset button'.
All in all though, the main characters aren't bad but they aren't ones where I would stare in awe at everything they say. The supporting characters are - well to put it bluntly, weak. By that I mean they simply aren't memorable and it's not something where you would look back and go ""maaan that young child who shot Spike is so cool - he's one really likable character"" I hope at least one or two people can catch the gist of what I'm trying to say.
Now, let me just say Cowboy Bebop is by no means a bad show. Far from it actually. It passes with flying colours in the presentation aspect but I simply couldn't buy into the episodic style of the story with characters that didn't really do anything. I just don't think it truly is the 'pinnacle of all anime shows'. However, it harbours a 'worth watching' in my rating system and should be viewed by anyone as it is STILL a classic.",7,NinjaMike28,

                Cowboy Bebop directed by Shinchiro Watanabe is one of, if not the best anime that has ever been made. You can call it unoriginal, predictable and you can say that the story is too rigid. The thing is, no other anime has done something like this with so much style and finesse. 
When I decided to write this review the best thing I could compare it to for me, was the video game The Last of Us, one of the most critically acclaimed and best games of all time. The story, the writing, the characters all kinda cliche, but what it does is perfect it
                  like no other work in the medium has. But saying this, the last of us has been out for a year and who knows when it will be beaten. Bebop has lasted for over fifteen years as the most beautiful and artistically, for the lack of better words, 'nailed it'. I emplore anyone who loves anime to watch this before they die, because no one has or will recreated the magic of Bebop.

No, seriously, why? I ask that because the show from a critical point of view, Cowboy Bebop should not be that perfect.
For one thing, it doesn't follow an actual story. I mean look at
                  we have here: a bunch of bounty hunters on a ship with no real goal other than to collect bounties. Are they trying to accomplish anything big? No, besides one of them is not even an actual bounty hunter but actually an androgynous little girl with excellent hacking skills. That's another thing, Faye only joins because she's a moocher and Ed joins because...(Insert Reason Here) and that's basically it. There is nothing else that these four try to accomplish in their time together.
...or so they don't think
You see here's my theory with Cowboy Bebop: The ship is a purgatory. These characters might think they have nothing in common but in reality that's not true. If anything, these characters have one huge big thing in common: They are all not at peace with their inner selves. I guess that's what the beauty of the series is. You are introduced to these characters and discover the kind of people they are and by the end you realize that they have finally discovered what has been plaguing them throughout the whole series leading to a climax that makes you want more but then again is overall a satisfying conclusion to great journey.
So in other words, while there is no real story to Cowboy Bebop, it's all the individual backstories that connect it all into one amazing tale. Maybe that's why I love Bebop a lot, and on top of this, the show gives us a presentation that is beyond unbelievable.
Cowboy Bebop's most significant trait is its ability to blend so many western genres into one. In one case, there is one episode that tributes Blaxploitation film and another that is a throwback to classic noir films, and the best part about all this that it's actually done extraordinarily well. Plus, for an anime that was released in 1998, visually it really holds up extremely well. Not only does Cowboy Bebop match its genre visually, but it also does it audio-wise. Yoko Kanno's status as one of the greatest composers in anime really shines here (in fact I believe that is the anime she is really known best for). For one thing, just like director Shinichiro Watanabe, she knows how capture the essence of a episode. For example, when the episode calls for Heavy Metal she goes all out, and so on. 
Voice acting is great in Japanese, but as any anime fan would know, Cowboy Bebop was the first prime example of how American dubbing got it right. In surprising twist, not only does the English track prove the quality of dubs wrong, but it is also the one of those rare times where an anime's English track is superior to Japanese track. You have Steve Blum as Ice-Cool Spike Spiegel, Wendee Lee as the voluptuous Faye Valentine, Beau Billingslea as the gruff yet fatherly Jet Black, and Melissa Fahn as the hyper and playful Edward (which compared to Aoi Tada makes her more likable then creepy). Four talented voice actors who to this day still get praised for their portrayals. I say if there is only one way to watch Bebop then the English track is only way to go.
So with all this in mind (the surprisingly deep story, the amazing visuals, the pitch-perfect soundtrack, and the absolutely lovable characters), this still doesn't answer the question: what is the one thing that makes Cowboy Bebop, at least to me the pinnacle of anime in general. Well I think if I were to put it simply it would have to be this: It's probably the only anime that actually feels mature when compared to other animes.
Sure, Cowboy Bebop has some anime conventions going for it: Edward's presence, Faye's physical anatomy, and character's unrealistic hair colors. However, none of this is forced, if anything, it feels kind of real. This is where the show succeeds, for once I am not sickened by Faye's fan-service, again I'm not annoyed by Ed, Jet while the tough guy really has a heart of gold, nothing about this anime feels over-the-top. When it does go over-the-top (and it does), it's handled carefully and doesn't go so far that it feels out of place in the show. That's why I love Cowboy Bebop the most. Let me tell you something: You might be like me with people judging you for watching anime, with me it's hard to sit in public with my computer open with me watching an episode of I don't know High School of the Dead, however, when I'm watching Cowboy Bebop, I don’t mind who’s glancing over. If anything, I would want them to come over and watch.
My point is I wish more animes were like Cowboy Bebop. That’s not to say I think all animes are bad because they can’t replicate it, definitely not that at all. My point is rather that I wish anime creators understand what Cowboy Bebop does right in terms of catering to certain audiences. Like I said, High School of the Dead may look and be intended for adults, but then there’s the fact that the show bases itself around gratuitous amounts of gore and well…fan-service, catering to specifically the male demographic of around 16-25.
Overall, Cowboy Bebop is the highest point of animes. It truly is, at least to me, the greatest anime of all time. It does everything that it wants to do right and it makes watching the show over and over again all the more refreshing. Seriously, I can pop in any episode of this show and have the same reaction I had the first time. Shinichiro Watanabe truly has completed a masterpiece and I believe if you are among the people who haven’t watched this show, then I suggest that you go out and watch it immediately. When you’re done, don’t be afraid to share it with people. Show your friends, show your friends who don’t like anime, show your parents, show your siblings, show your English teacher, I DON’T KNOW JUST DO IT! Also, I suggest you do it now, as in buy a copy of the show now because Bandai Entertainment will soon stop distributing this work of art at least to the U.S. market. Support this show and the anime industry anyway. Believe me when I say out of all the animes you will ever watch in your life, I swear that Cowboy Bebop will be the one you will enjoy no matter what. Even if it doesn’t become your favorite anime, I swear that you will feel satisfied that you have watched it at all. Until then, See You Space Cowboy.",10,Nito-San,

                Shinichirō Watanabe's badass space western Cowboy Bebop prepares viewers for an exciting adventure of the galaxy's hottest new frontiersmen. As an intricately crafted composition of natural characters, passionate music, dark tones, and relatable themes, this epic stands the test of time as one of Japanese animation's finest masterpieces.
Story (read the synopsis first!)
Structurally, episodes, throughout the series and hereafter referred to as ""sessions"", focus on isolated events, pertaining either to a particular bounty, backstory, or random ""filler"" event. Fans of stories that are less structured and more character oriented will be satisfied in that sense, as the main plot of Spike's conflict with crime lord Vicious
                  and the Red Dragon crime syndicate appears in tight bursts throughout the series. However, despite the disjointed pattern, the series flows in a way that leaves the viewer feeling satisfied and never disconnected from any particular character.
A welcome positive of the writing is the no-holds-barred attitude the writers take in regards to the plot. The world of Bebop is a harsh, unforgiving world, and even down to the gritty end we find that no single character is safe. Though at times you may feel emotionally pained over a decision they made, in the end you'll understand it was the right one to make.
Despite most episodes being good fun, Cowboy Bebop thematically provides a strong insight into the nature of isolation, purpose of existence, and consequences of the past. Spike is the principal instrument used by writers to convey thematic discourse, though mirrors of this behavior is seen in equally troubled partners Faye and Jet as well. Without spoiling too much, know that you'll view the deeply human struggles of the protagonists (and antagonists) with an air of familiarity and understanding.
Genre and Characteristics
Now, we can't be having ""cowboys"" and ""bounties"" without a little action, can we? Cowboy Bebop is a western by design, and with that comes adventure, hardship, and yes, fighting. Between hand-to-hand combat, bar fights, cosmic dogfighting, and katanas (yes, fucking katanas), a viewer's bloodlust will consistently be sated through the variety of action scenes present. Honestly, for the time in which this series was released, you'll be thoroughly impressed by how awesome everything looks.
As the series is set in a futuristic version of today's galaxy, science fiction plays an integral part in world development. Spaceships and hyperspace gateways replace most of today's logistics of automobiles and highways. Earth has been made mostly inhabitable, and as a result, humans live mostly on other planets in the solar system (notably Mars). Each planet retains its own personality and atmosphere, shown vibrantly through the respective color palettes, architecture, and populations. Multi-culturalism is heavily prevalent throughout the locales, with regions mimicking that of Tijuana, New York, or Beijing. Telebroadcasts are often noted as being available in multiple languages, leading us to believe there is a sense of globalism and unity throughout the galaxy. Watanabe's colonized galaxy certainly does create an interesting perspective of what the future for humanity may be like.
Animation
Surprisingly enough, Cowboy Bebop retains animation quality advanced for its time. Watanabe and Sunrise Studios overall proved themselves throughout as being able to maintain a high standard of quality. There's a certain amount of fluidity present within most motions, and characters react naturally and often under a given circumstance.
I found myself constantly in awe with was how stellar (no pun intended) the cinematography was throughout the anime. Watanabe understood how vital camera shots were to conveying what was to be expressed. When new locales are introduced, there was a frequent use of panning long shots to convey the relative size of the world. A juxtaposition is formed between the characters and the world, showing how insignificant humanity is to the greater above, tying in well with the thematic tone of the anime. Atmosphere is never in question with how masterfully each one is produced. Color tones, camera angles, and character placement all help to convey the intended feeling of a shot.
One of the common ""sins"" found within anime is that the ""show, don't tell"" rule is often disregarded in favor of a dialogue driven exposition. The latter is true for Cowboy Bebop, as we learn of the lore of the future galaxy through visually seeing it. For example, despite being a civilization that has managed space travel, there are still many pockets of poverty present as evident in many episodes. Spike's mysterious past is never spoken out in detail, rather throw short, ambiguous flashbacks that form the pieces to a greater puzzle. There's a certain degree of interactivity present that gives the viewer a stronger connection than had he or she just been explicitly lectured.
Sound
I can't think of very many other titles, save maybe for the cousin of Samurai Champloo, that have soundtracks as distinctly stylized as Cowboy Bebop's. Loyal to the name, jazz is the specific theme that composer Yoko Kanno intended for the series, and it's a theme that fits well. The spirit of expression, improvisation, passion, and divergence is indeed the character of Cowboy Bebop. Kanno masterfully utilized the tracks at fitting times throughout the series, greatly emphasizing the intended tone of a scene. One of the greatest analogies I can think of would be how well Susumu Hirasawa organized the abstract composition for Berserk ('97-98).
The voice acting, as is to be expected with such a critically acclaimed series, is fantastic. Cowboy Bebop is one of the few animes that can proudly say it has a dubbed version, so it is the viewers choice which version they'd like to hear. Personally, though this may conflict with most western enthusiasts, I prefer the Japanese voice actors.
Both the opening and ending tracks, ""Tank!"" and ""The Real Folk Blues"", respectively, are my all-time favorites. Kanno knew well how to begin and end the series, as the former gets you hyped up to all hell and the latter leaves you a pensive, emotional wreck. Ready yourself.
Characters
If the world is the framework, the soundtrack the soul, and the animation the paint, Bebop's characters must be the muse. Cowboy Bebop is uniquely designed in that the story forms around the characters rather than the opposite. A certain amount of incredulity is eliminated when characters are written so well they speak as normal people. Watanabe didn't want to spin a tale, rather relay an epic of five adventurers.
To that end, we don't see the crew as tools of a story, rather a group of friends that could be considered a family (albeit fairly dysfunctional). Spike is our flawed but lovable antihero, Jet his hardworking, moralistic foil. Faye the seductive femme fatale with a tendency for certain vices. Edward is our eccentric but useful hacker, and Ein the intelligent pupper. They're a ragtag bunch, but damn it, they work well together, and you grow to love them with each session.
Enjoyment
Needless to say, Cowboy Bebop was a wild ride. Session after sessions, my satisfaction never wavered. There's a certain richness to this series that gets you drunk off it, always lusting for another bounty.
Part of what made the show so fun for me was its westernized tone. While in Japan this may have been seen as foreign and intriguing, for those of us in the West, we see this as familiar and welcoming. Cowboys are kind of our thing, you know? Seeing a skillfully written Japanese perspective on what entails a ""space cowboy"" presents a fun experience for us western folk. It's funny how on both sides of the coin it can be a positive.
Conclusion
The things that come to mind when I recall this anime come easily: cigarettes, smirks,  and woolongs. Funny how the slightest things can leave the biggest imprints, but that's exactly the intended effect. Be it the down-to-earth characters, comprehensive universe, or passionate scoring, the ""new genre itself"" Cowboy Bebop never leaves your heart. Even fifty-four years from now, no matter what new series are critically acclaimed, people will come back to and relive the experiences of that work with the same spark of excitement and adventure they once beared. We've all got a little space cowboy in us.

                Overview-10/10
The story of Cowboy Bebop is the misadventures of a group of space cowboys/bounty hunters with a rift of humor, drama, adventure, action and sci-fi that blend together well with old-time jazz backtracks. From the genius of Shinichiro Watanabe was where this space adventure sprang from and it is an old gem I will always love! And the end is a cliffhanger, leaving you wondering what happened
Art-10/10
Watanabe puts some great thought into the appearance of his charachters. They are intricatey designed to fit their persona. Spike Spiegel, our cool-as-ice, sharply dressed hero had a great design with tones of blue and yellow. Perfect compliment!
Sound-9/10
The voice
                  actors in the dub (which I usually watch to get a clear picture in my head for my fanfics) are perfect, for the most part. Steve Blum, one of my all time fave voice actors, plays Spike Spiegel, and Wendee Lee plays the sexy and daring Faye Valentine. Their voices are well-suited. The jazzy backing music made for a mysterious and mellow environment, as well as spazzy chase scenes. The ending theme, the real folk blues
Charachters-10/10
The charachters are intricate and have very good backstories, be they major or one timers. Spike's romance with a beautiful blonde and rivalry with an old comerade are riveting to watch.
Parental Warnings
Violence-Strong
There are brutal shootings, combat, and fistfights strewn throughout, but nothing too terribly gory.
Language-Moderate
Swearing here and there, but nothing much
Sex/Nudity-Mild
There are a few sex references and jokes, as well as a brief gay love scene
Frightening/Intense scenes-Moderate
There is a scene where someone is beat up, as well as several deaths",10,SakuraRose,

                Bebop is one of the best animes of all time. Loaded with action, comedy, drama, romance, all in a sci-fi setting; it is a classic. Best english dub ever... I don't think I've ever seen an entire episode in Japanese.
Memorable characters. Spike is my favorite anime character of all time; my Spike Spiegel Messenger Bag might just be one of the best purchases I've ever made.
Awesome music. I listen to the soundtrack every single day. The jazz is amazing, as only Yoko Kanno and The Seatbelts could make such a spectacle. It's the main reason for my favorite radio station being CD101.9

                Cowboy Bebop: Spoiler free review
A truly surreal expirence to be had, Cowboy Bebop blends copious and subtle amounts of almost every genre.
A picturesque expirence teeming with euphoria and a wonderful sense of adventure. The world is uniquley crafted
and truly feels like its own.
Story 7/10 Cowboy bebop has an interesting concept of potraying it's story.
Being an episodic adventure, sure each episode has a different plot, but intertwined is segments from the character's pasts, taking us into the present to be projected into the future.
There is very little and a lot going on all at once spanned over this 26 episodic escapade!
Simply put; we start in the
                  present, slowly unveil the past, and follow the characters into their future.
Characters 7.5/10 Cowboy Bebop is more character interaction than character
development, and the interactions are well composed. The main characters have a lot of major differences,
but that is not to say they fit well together. They bring out the best and worst of
one another, which makes for some pleasantly awesome scenarios. Although progression isn't a main
focus, it is sometimes brought to the foreground through; learning who a character once was or what they were like
and who they are now, or are becoming. Cowboy Bebop has a unique way of unfolding their awesome cast of characters.
Art Direction 8/10 Most modern day animes by comparison still don't do what Cowboy Bebop did in 1998!
Action scenes are crisp and fluid, colors are done in a nice gritty finnese for the most part. Artsy
moments ranging from vibrant with color, to the serene and subtle and moments with artistic pizazz!.
Music 10/10 If you're familiar with Yoko Kanno(the composer) you have already come to know her exceptional
quality. This soundtrack is truly outstanding. Contemporary jazz, up-beat techno, surreal musical compositions
truly every genre can be found here. For 26 episodes there is a WIDE array
of tracks to be heard, and even American tracks from some well-known artists! The music brings the art direction
and whole feel of cowboy bebop alive, overflowing with a truly genuine effort to combine with the anime and bring
it to its peak. Every song fits every moment it is cast into, without being forced.
Cowboy Bebop will capture the attention of almost any anime fan, whether they are looking for action, adventure, sci-fi, even some casual
slice of life elements. Each episode is written by a different individual, but there is an overall sense of
direction. Overall I give Cowboy Bebop a 8/10
Disclaimer: Some episodes can have a dramatically different feel, and I found some episodes to be personally slow.
Do not let this deter you from missing out on an overall great anime!

                So I really tried to like this show. I have a couple childhood friends that love it but dont really give much of a reason why, they just swear by it so i gave it a go. Mind you, im typically into anime that illicit some kind of emotional reaction whether is laughter, crying, goosebumps from action or anger from characters making misakes.
This anime did not get much of a reaction at all. I might have chuckled a couple times at the most. Theres little to no background music, the action is short lived and not very nice to look at, its on angel beats
                  levels of boredom. If it show doesnt turn up the intensity or give you something to look forward to or build up tension in the first 6 to 12 episodes then why keep coming back.
Its a space western basically the mandalorian without the comedy, the beautiful action sequences, or the aesthetic. I was falling asleep through almost each episode. And its a shame because usually old but gold anime like this have something very redeeming about it whether its the action sequences, the drama, or the comedy, and unfortunately it doesnt compare to anything modern. The underlying plot doesnt reveal itself im sure till over 12 episodes in which for something with one season is a crime!",4,JayBoogieoogie,

Constructive criticism is welcome via PM or comment. All appreciated. 
I hate episodic animes. I hate them so much to a point where I break my keyboard whenever I'm watching one. Cowboy Bebop is no exception. I hated it. I hated it so much to a point that I loved it. I don't know if that makes sense but that's how I feel about this masterpiece. 
STORY (Concept 4.5/5, Development 4.5/5)The concept is rather cliche. Future technology in combination with the Big Wild West and Jazzy feel. 
This doesn't mean it is not good. History shows how copying good stuff is always good. And the idea of ""Space Cowboy"" is simply cool and awesome. 
By definition, filler episodes are episodes that are just there without any connection to the purpose of the anime. What makes cowboy bebop amazing is that its fillers have purposes. 
As a person who greatly criticizes on Black Butler and Darker than Black's episodic storyline, I cannot do the same to Cowboy. 
Unlike Black Butler, every little episodes in Cowboy is extremely interesting, which means, NOT boring. In Cowboy most if not all episodes stand strong on their own, so the connections they have with the main plot are clear and meaningful. 
Unlike Darker than Black, the main characters of the show stays as the main characters. So all arcs have Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed as the center of the plot. 
All the characters have their own episodes. These episodes are scatters all over the place so we the viewers can change the flavor once in a while.  
My main problem with the show is that, I don't have the motivation to go to the next episodes... I guess that's just me. 
The ending is awesome.
All in all, this is how you do episodic show. I respect it despite the fact I don't like episodic show. They deserve the credit of making all the episodes interesting. 
CHARACTERS (Design 5/5, Development 5/5)
As I said previously, all the characters have their own background and development. 
The Bebop Crew consists of Spike the Cowboy, Faye the hotty, Jet the daddy, Ed the kid and Ein the dog. 
Spike is probably the most interesting cowboy in all of existence. For a lack of better term, he is a serious person, yet a troll. He is super positive, he is a likable person who is supposed to be the ""Bang"" on the ship. He died once, which adds layers and layers of mystery on top of this badass cowboy. As the show unfolds, his past is resolved...
Faye and Jet are also very interesting. Like spike, they find Bebop their new home and abandoned their past. Unlike Spike, they are truly able to abandon their history and reborn. Spike is different from the rest of the crew because he cannot run away, or he choose to not run away. 
Ed doesn't really have any personally background. She is a fun little character that infuses herself with the Bebop. She has her place in the show and I think the way they present it is great.
Ein is the best dog in the history of humanity. Period. 
GRAPHIC (Art 5/5 Animation 5/5)
The art is godlike. They are so gorgeous. The space scenes and the different planets are mind blowing. Characters are also very well designed. 
Let's just put it this way so people would not run away because ""old animations suck"". 
Cowboy Bebop has 1998 animation that is better than the majority of the 2018 animations. The pictures are literally drawn BY HAND, FRAME BY FRAME. I could not believe my eyes when I stepped in to the episode. They are simply so smooth and detailed. The only time when you would see something that's recycled is when the spaceships take off. Action scenes are awesome. 
The only thing I can say that is not appealing is that I watched a 4:3 series on a 16/9 screen. :/
SOUND (OP/ED 3/3, OST 3/3 Audio 4/4)
Not gonna explain the OP and the ED, go listen yourself. They are on youtube. (they are fantastic) 
OST. So much emotions. So much feels. I would say one can only hate it if he/she hates jazz. Who hates jazz? 
The dub. This is one of the first GOOD dubs made by the Americans. I think even the dub haters should at least respect the work. That said, the Original audio has great feels and tones as well. 
However, the stage of the show is in this multi cultural space. All sorts of people from different nationalities tag alone. I don't know about the Japanese version but the English does have great accent and it just feels right that a cowboy speaks English, isn't it? 
ENJOYMENT (9/10)
I loved the series. It is definitely in my top 3 if not top 1. But there were times during the show that I felt bored :/ 
The beginning was not that good either. Well comparing to the rest of the series at least. 
And yea, I still don't like episodic anime. 
I never cried for any show. But if I need to cry for a show, it's gotta be the ending of Bebop or Steins;Gate. (no i haven't watched clannad and Brotherhood yet)

                You know how people talk about that movie that is just a ""classic,"" the kind of movie you just /have/ to see at least once in your life? The one that was the /first/ of its kind, the one that started it all?
For me, that movie was the Godfather. Bare with me here, obviously Bebop is not a mob story (though there are some underground organizations). But like the Godfather it has a very large fanbase of people who praise the movie like it was shit from the anus of Jesus Christ himself and will slit your throat if you so dare to criticize it.
                  
I did not love the Godfather. I didn't understand what was so special about it... it was just like every other mob movie I've ever seen. It was basically a shorter version of the Sopranos with a more satisfying ending. My family of diehard italians wanted to murder me in my sleep after I admitted my apparent lack of taste, but I couldn't help it. 
Now unless you live a very blessed life, you've probably watched one of those classic movies and came away with the same feeling. Maybe it was all of the hype, or maybe it was just because you've seen it done so many times before and can't appreciate the originality. Either way, you watched it and you weren't that impressed.
Bebop is like the anime version of those classics.
Personally, I loved Bebop. Which is why I said ""to hell with it"" and gave it a 10 like so many others. That being said, I can definitely see how people may have issues with the show. 
It isn't amazing for everyone, and if you're going to watch it I highly suggest you attempt to disregard all of the hype. The show is a masterpiece for reasons that don't resonate with everyone, and going in with a certain mindset might skew your opinion 
Bebop is basically about a bunch of oddballs living together on a spaceship and occasionally catching bounties (do they ever actually catch one? I can't remember). To put it simply, the show is very episodic. Most people may call it ""all filler,"" but that's sort of the point. 
It isn't one straight narrative with a linear plot. It's not ""going"" anywhere. It's about the everyday life of the characters, and everyday life is pretty random. Especially if you're floating through space on a spaceship with no real aspirations or goals. 
The characters are taking every day one step at a time, and the plot reflects that. And as you learn more about the characters, you come to understand why they have this attitude 
Through the episodes, the characters are more fanned out. This is where the writing really shines. There are moments in this show that are, in my opinion, fucking amazing. (see episode 5 ""Ballad of Falling Angels"" church scene) Moments that make you shout ""holy shit"", and moments that may hit you like a bullet through the heart. The characters are realistic and three dimensional despite the fact you don't really know /that/ much about them, and it's through those (admittedly scarce) moments. 
The rest of the time you just have ministories about different bounties. They're amusing stories (most of the time) and I honestly enjoyed them. But I can definitely understand how this set up isn't for everyone. 
really 
Basically, don't go in with certain expectations. The show isn't for everyone. It is episodic, and what you may consider the ""plot"" only comes up in brief moments. These moments are great, but if you're not the kind of person who enjoys the in between, then you're not going to enjoy the show. 
And there's nothing wrong with not enjoying the show. 
Just like there's nothing wrong with me hating the Godfather.

                Even back in my high school years, when I used to catch a random episode of Cowboy Bebop on Adult Swim, and I would be thoroughly entertained.
Now, as an adult, I have come to appreciate this anime even more. Cowboy Bebop is not an anime that follows today's ""Let's make everyone pretty, and kill a dramatic scene by throwing an iron pan at someone's head"". Cowboy Bebop, to me, is the essence of what a great anime is.
Even though the show's main storyline is only truly there through a small handful of episodes, each episode leaves the viewer thoroughly entertained. Each character gets their moment
                  in the sun, so to speak, with some intriguing info on their backstory (usually in the form of an episode) that left me completely glued to the screen.
Awesome soundtrack (I still have it on my playlist to this day) , paired with great characters and well written episode to episode stories, leave the viewer wishing more anime out there did the same thing.
I found it shocking that this anime was not listed in the top 3. Cowboy Bebop still has great rewatch value for me (maybe every couples years or so, but it's there) .

                ""And the work which has become a genre upon itself is called: Cowboy Bebop."" It's hard not to raise a skeptical eyebrow at the cocksure bravado displayed in the statement, and one might be tempted to proceed with the intent to smash this assertion, as well as the overwhelming praises this show has received, into pieces. 
Except it was entirely justified. 
Sure, Cowboy Bebop is actually a pastiche of genres heavily influenced by classic American films; spaghetti western, space road trip, gangland crime drama, buddy comedy, etc. But through amalgamation of these narrative elements, it has morphed into a unique creation with tremendous amount of
                  polish and flair, consisted of wildly varied bounty-of-the-week episodes and punctuated by  individual character arcs that end up becoming the series' highlights.  
What the show did with its characters are truly special. They started off as strangers to the audience and to each other (except for Spike and Jet, who are already acquainted in the beginning), only to gradually reveal fascinating layers of personality and history. There's no big drama or obvious bonding scenes between them, but as they bickered, cooperated, and told stories to each other, a subtle  bond is formed throughout the show and I couldn't help but be emotionally invested at their fates. It is through these characters, particularly in the different ways they react to their past demons (*a recurring motif), that the series got the substance to go along with its dazzling style. The writing of the show also made excellent use of symbolism and thematic delivery through subtle means; it's never distracting nor overly obtuse, and it's there to reward those actively looking to unravel more from the narrative.  
Much has already been said about series director Shinichiro Watanabe, screenwiter Keiko Nobumoto, and composer Yoko Kanno, so I'm pretty much just preaching to the choir here, but I'll say it anyway:  this is one hell of a team, and we're lucky to have them in the anime industry. Th their vision, the world of Bebop is a rich, diverse,cornucopia of colorful characters set against the backdrop of sweet gorgeous music. I'm not a fan of jazz, and normally I don't even pay much attention to a show's given oST unless it's really exceptional or really terrible, but the composition and performance in this show is really something else. The Seatbelts, a multi-national and heavily instrumental band spearheaded by Kanno, contributed an incredible variety and quantity of stuff that became integral in setting the mood, whether it's the extremely iconic instrumental OP in Tank!, the gorgeous wordless vocal in ELM,  the haunting lyric of Call Me to accompany one of the most heart-breaking scenes in any anime, or the somber jazz piece of Space Lion, just to name a few examples from a (very) deep list. 
I couldn't find it in me to give me a perfect score; my enjoyment of the stand-alone episodes are uneven, and the show never really sustained a sense of momentum until the final three episodes. I could also see someone watching this for the first time and find it to not really be that compelling, but it's important to note that Cowboy Bebop really became something special through repeat viewings, where one is more attuned to observe the homages, foreshadowing, and hidden nuggets of information in even the least consequential episode. Bottom line, if you're looking for something with serious entertainment and artistic merits, you owe it to yourself to watch this. Twice, at least.",9,Beobachter,
1,"
                100% style, 0% story. Seriously, I never knew why the characters were doing anything, there seemed to be no overarching story and no story to speak off in the induvidual episodes. They just sort of roamed around space and did stuff impulsively without clear motivation as to why. Some concepts, world lore and character backstories was introduced but they didn't do anything with it and in the end it didn't really matter. 
It didn't feel like there was some greater goal except making enough money to eat. I can already experience this in my own life so why would I want to see a depressed
                  group of people do the same thing but in space? 
I was bored watching this, didn't feel like there was anything to be invested in. The only thing this gets points for is the artstyle.",3,Kvltistsu,
1,"
                I went into this show with the expectation that I might like it more but I ended up liking it significantly less. There are way too many things I could say, I am going to make it short. This will mean a lot of my thoughts will probably be not delivered as well as I wish but it is what it is. My main takeaway is that I actually do not like a single thing about this show. 
Don’t confuse this with dislike though. The first time I thought I appreciated its artistry, the show is factually well produced but when it comes to actual
                  appeal, it doesn’t appeal to me whatsoever. The art is well drawn but not aesthetically unique or interesting. The colors are 90s, they aren’t vibrant, they aren’t flat. They are just colors. The character designs are cool and make sense for the setting (Faye is questionable but idc) but they do not appeal to my aesthetic sensitivities. The Ost is there. I overall liked 3 tracks in the entire show, and with liked I mean noticed and enjoyed greatly. The rest was unnoticeable or unimpressive. So basically, decent but nothing I will list in my favorite OST list. The plot – I honestly doubt there even is one. Yes, yes, there is the thematic core of Spike’s character arc that eventually reaches its climax by the end, but I felt it wasn’t overarchingly as important as other shows, especially plot driven ones. This show is a tale of a few characters, hence why it is episodic, but I failed to see relevance or major takeaways in the episodic stories towards the characters or even to just worldbuild the world. In the end it just ends up being a space show where things happen to people. I know that isn’t really a sentence that describes anything nor is it not something that could be said about everything but it is the rawest way for me to state my particular feelings towards this series. Over the span of 26 episodes, I thought 7 were good at best. I didn’t count but it was definitely not more than 9. And with good I mean good, not great not amazing. The rest was either bad, dreadfully bad, unamusing, or okay. 
Spike is a character that barely reacts to his surroundings so I don’t ever know what he thinks or worries about, so when his arc ends, I am just kinda… okay? I did enjoy Faye’s character backstory the most, the tape scene being the most emotionally engaging. I don’t understand how the syndicate relates to anything in the universe, or how bad they are in that universe etc. I am not ashamed to admit I do not understand some things in this show but I don’t “understand” them in a personal way that would connect me to the overall narrative in a meaningful way, not in a plot-understanding way (nobody will understand this sentence lmao). I also think Vicious is extreme toast bread villain. All he does is look ugly and quote some poetic nonsense, Spike does that too sometimes. The quoting went out of hand towards the end. All these things are still mature in a way, like they don’t offend me or are pretentious, but they are really underwhelming in many ways. When it comes to a “main” character involved in a rivalry with a villain that is actually good, Psycho-Pass is better at that. It is also better with its “episodic” narrative to expand the world, and I think PP’s worldbuilding isn’t the best. 
Speaking of episodic, having a “driver” MC react or engage with episodic people’s tragedies, Kino is way better at that than Spike, though Kino is a non-actor (usually). Also took away more lessons per episode in that show than I did here. Then OST and aesthetic; I have a myriad of shows I like more than this. VEG which I don’t like much because of its last few episodes also had me way more emotionally engaged than this show. 
I am saying all of this to justify my score basically. I am not giving Bebop a 5 because I think it is average as far as anime on a major scale go. As I already said, it is at least mature about the things it is doing, I just have seen shows that do similar things way better than it, and I am not into those shows either. I wasn’t emotionally engaged or entertained. There is not much to criticize about it as an anime production because at the time they were high tier, but they aren’t appealing to my tastes. The characters are fine but I don’t “like” them. I don’t find their team interactions special. The pacing is also egregiously slow I felt. In any case I would even say it is the exact same show as Dandy, but a bit more “mature”, but Dandy had overall more episodes I “cared” about.
The last 3 episodes were honestly great. I really liked the tone, the OST was the best it ever has been and it tied the knots of the very minimal plot we have gotten so far together really well. However I still feel like it doesn’t entirely excuse the lack of consistency until this point and it also failed to round out these characters in non-trope ways. Julia just kinda represents this weird male gaze masculine power fantasy for the male character of sacrificing yourself for your loved one after they have passed, but before you do you take revenge. Basically, the plot of any B-type action film where the wife dies at the start of the film. I don’t see how this is any different. It kinda just bores me at this point.
Either way, I think I heard the shot now, and this will be the last time I ever watch this show again. I am glad if you got some great catharsis from any of the character arcs, but I just did not. This wouldn’t be the first show that is a bit “older” that I watched and my main takeaway was “it certainly was monumental for its time” and it probably won’t be the last time.",5,eff-fume,

                This is my First Review! I never watched anime until i took an anime film course last semester and for our research paper we had to choose an anime series. I chose the show Cowboy Bebop as ive heard of its praise, and i was blown away. I was so impressed by the characters, the inner struggles and backstory of Spike, Jet, and Faye and watching them grow and develop was so engaging, the narrative structure was complex and refreshing and it was just so Stylish! from the opening all the way to the end. i wasnt even a fan of jazz until i watched
                  this show, the jazz/blues theme plays through every scenario in the show and compliments the characters and visuals very well. Cowboy bebop so far is the most Complete story ive seen and i am constantly recommending it to people that refuse to watch anime because they say ""its just cartoons"", let them watch this they will be impressed. I am now addicted to anime and have watched a couple of shows since this and im glad i was introduced to a whole new genre of tv and film. By the way you will get hooked on the soundtrack so here are some of the names of the songs you will download.

                Looking for an anime mixed with futuristic bounty hunters and jazz?  Then this one is for you.  Cowboy Bebop is overall, one of my favorite animes ever.  Perhaps you're saying to yourself, the rating is a bit exaggerated.  But this is not the case, allow me to explain myself.
Story: A very original, and heart-pounding story.  One that tells a story of love, hate, and overall pure excitement!
Art: Perhaps not the best of it's time, but certainly among them.  Cowboy Bebop delivers very beautiful artwork, especially with all the images of the future.
Sound: Both the Japanese and English tracks were
                  filled with great voice acting.  Also the sounds hit dead on perfection.  The interesting part about Cowboy Bebop is it's close relation to the jazz genre.  Much enjoyment of the sound from the brilliant artist Yoko Kanno.
Character: This was a huge plus for Cowboy Bebop.  The characters showed a very unique aura in their own way.  Matching very well with the atmosphere of Cowboy Bebop.  Spike being the main protagonist, also showing very mixed emotions showing much humor.
Enjoyment: I very well enjoyed Cowboy Bebop.  Perhaps it was the queer attitude of some characters, or the total hilarious moments.  It's one anime I can watch over and over again, and still enjoy.
Overall:  Cowboy Bebop is an amazing anime which will hold a place in my heart forever.  Not only did I love it, but it played a big part in my life as well.  It's a great show for people of all ages.  Mixing classic jazz, futuristic bounty hunters, and great fight scenes.  Cowboy Bebop is one anime i would recommend to anyone.",10,Tam-Chan,

                Hey there space cowboy/girl!!
Today I’ll be reviewing Cowboy Bebop. It wasn’t that long ago that I was sceptical with the quality an anime from the 90’s could produce. Of course my doubts were put to bed with the likes of Neon Genesis Evangelion.
So the story revolves around Spike a bounty hunter who travels around on a spaceship called ‘Bebop’ with his partner Jet who owns the ship. Together the two go around looking for bounty heads to cash in on, though more often then not failing to succeed. Along the way we have the addition of Faye and Radical Edward who join in
                  on the shenanigans.
Don’t let the brief above fool you into thinking this is a happy-go-lucky bounty hunt full of comical failures. Oh no, you are in for a much better surprise than that. Cowboy Bebop has a good thing going, it has its priorities set straight from the get go and builds on it for the continuation of the series. The main characters get a great deal of screen time and have entire episodes dedicated for their back stories which few shows do now-a-days.
Let’s turn our attention to the characters. Now I’m not going to go out of my way to hail the cast of Cowboy bebop ‘’AMAZING’ but the characters are very enjoyable. Spike is a old fashioned bad-ass, he always seem to get the job done in the end, but not with ease as the show portrays his flaws and the effort he has to put in so that things go his way. Spike is simply that cool guy you wanted to be in high school and not because he was a douche bag who bullied guys and skipped class to smoke, but because he is an all-round honourable and respectable man. Next is Jet he is that authority figure he is short tempered and very grumpy, but inside he’s just a softie. He is a likeable character and usually does the right thing. His story arc wasn’t that favourable to the other characters, but I still liked Jet as a whole. Next up is Faye. She takes the role of a femme-fatale. She is bitchy, hot-headed and a compulsive gambler. On top of that her memories were forgotten while she was in cryogenic freezing. Giving her story arc the annoying “I NEED TO KNOW WHO I AM. Kind of story arc which is annoying. Faye does however have her moments and I liked her. Finally we have Ed. She came along later in the series as the geeky, hyperactive computer hacker who doesn’t know any better. Ed is that bit of comic relief on the side. She lightens the tone and occasionally will give you a chuckle because she is just adorable.
The art in the series is great for its time, in comparison to today’s standards it is appalling but again it came out in the late 90’s so you can’t really fault the show. The sound is very jazzy, well that’s what I gathered from the opening and it continues throughout the show as it fits in with the western tone of the series.
Enjoyment, this plays a great part in this show as whether you enjoy the cowboy themes will be a contributing factor on whether the series does it for you or not. I found this to be very enjoyable the action scenes were fluent and exciting. The sci-fi elements also make it a good watch for fans of that genre, it does appeal to a relatively large audience. Those who don’t enjoy the series probably prefer the romance or magical girl/fantasy genre. Most people will find something to enjoy about the series
Overall Cowboy Bebop was a fun ride I thoroughly enjoyed the series and although not every episode was spectacular there are things to give merit for. I’d also like to point out the ridiculously spontaneous episode 11. For those old fashioned, wannabe cowboys this is a must watch. Overall the series was an 8/10 and gets a definite recommendation from me.

                Unlike some anime shows, this one does not grip you at the start, and some of the best/most interesting characters do not come in until a lot later.  The animation is slightly dated, and there are few special effects such as we are used to now.  The ""futuristic"" world shown is perhaps more reliant on spaceships, space travel, and successful colonization of neighbouring planets than is realistic.  However, despite these flaws, Cowboy Bebop remains an overall entertaining, engaging and, somewhat surprisingly, a moving show.
Great things about this show - the characters - they do have personality, annoyingly we never see the full
                  depth of some of the characters, even by the end of the show there are still some mysteries that are never solved.  The people in the show give a good idea of the feeling and setting of the show, a series of run-down, rather sorry worlds after the almost ultimate demise of the first.  
The animation, as I said earlier, lacks special effects, particularly in the space-scenes, that we are accustomed to seeing in the 21st century, however the actual character designs are somewhat wacky and goofy at first - but ultimately, wonderful.  The unrealistically long legs and odd, long movements of the people in the show characterize its style, and somehow help to define the people in the show.  In particular the unrealistically wobbly arms of Ed (a character who arrives a little bit later) give us a good idea of his/her carefree, wacky, young, ""wobbly"" personality.
Some of the episodes, especially considering those nearer the end, feel a great deal like filler episodes, but almost every one is worth watching for the build-up to the last few, plus the film which came after this series and happens at some point ""between"" two of the episodes.  Most of the episodes in the beginning and middle give us little snippets of the characters' backgrounds and the plot which comes into play later on (most of the episodes are basically separate storylines).  
The music is also a highlight of the show, most of being composed by Yoko Kanno, famous for her diverse anime soundtracks.  Well, the variety and depth of music in Cowboy Bebop should not disappoint.  Some of it is country/folk music, fitting the Western theme of the series (COWBOY), but that which is not, is less expected and is fitting to whatever mood the show is trying to portray.
I thoroughly recommend Cowboy Bebop, even if, on the surface, it does not appear to be your sort of anime show.  The kind of anime I generally watch does not fall into many, if any, of Cowboy Bebop's categories (e.g Ao No Exorcist, Blood Lad, Persona 4: The Animation), but I have absolutely no regrets whatsoever after watching a show of this nature.  Trust me, even if it is not your sort of thing, you'll have to admit, even if after watching only one episode, that Cowboy Bebop has its merits.",9,Mightyzebra,

                Warning :Minor Spoilers ahead
Ok, it's been a while since i saw this anime in top 30 anime list. Looking at the year it was aired I wasn't really interested to watch it. But after some friends recommend it to me and after I read sooo many reviews that give ten to Cowboy Bebop, I decided to watch it. At that time I was tired of animes that show too much moe, ecchi, and other stuff and I'll try the claasic ones. And.. It was..
Story : (7/10)
Ok, it has very interesting setting, a futuristic world where people have started living in other planets. Our MCs here,
                  are bounty hunters who have their own unique past. Interesting setting right? Unfortunately, the execution of the story can't deliver it to the audience very well. Cowboy Bebop is  too episodic which almost each episode has each own story. And from this episodic episodes, huge conflicts are only in 5 episodes or something ( if I remember it correctly). I wouldn't mind if other episodes are exciting, but most of it are flat and seems useless. You can even throw some episodes away and it doesn't affect the main story. Watching Cowboy Bebop makes me tired of waiting about Spike's past and what will happen to him and Vicious. I have to watch some uninteresting and some useless episodes before i got to see it. It makes me bored. well, but Spike's story was amazing so I think it's worth waiting.   
Art : (8/10)
Art is very good. I like the character designs. Animation was amazing and makes me wonder if it really was made in 90's.
Sound : (8/10)
Nice OST
Enjoyment : (7/10)
Like I said before, it is hard to enjoy Bebop because some episodes seem useless and feel like filler. Some episodes are just plain and don't excite me. I can really enjoy only a few episodes.
Overall : (7/10)
Overall, 7. It was interesting, but it wasn't exciting. Main concept is very good, but too many plain episodes. Maybe because it's classic, some rate it very high (mostly 10). But I don't want too rate it according to the time it was made. I won't divide anime between classic or not. I was also confused to rate it whether 7 or 8. I chose 7 finally. I think it deserves 8. But to me, 8.83 seems little overrated. But well, for those retro anime fans, I'm sorry. People have different opinion sometimes, right?",7,jejehartadi,

                Story 6/10
I mean it is not a bad story but is it really that ""great""? A bunch of bounty hunters and a kid link up to go on adventures together while exploring a rather bland world set in space. The stories (episodes) could have been more exciting, with more plot twists, big reveals and emotionally driven. Frankly it was too straight forward for me to consider it anything amazing.
Art 8/10
For a 90s anime it has aged very well. The spaceships are very unique and the environment represent space travel dystopian suited to its time.
Sound 9/10
At first I was like ""this OP is garbage and ED
                  is okay"". Then as it went on, I discovered the soundtrack within the episodes to be the best part of the series for me personally. The songs are varied, the instrumentals are atmospheric and certain tracks fitted with the scenarios perfectly. Although I warn you, I only started to appreciate it later in the series.
Character 6/10
I think I would have touched a nerve with scoring the characters this low but  they are mediocre. They are not particularly interesting when you compare them to something like One Piece where every character whether side or main are filled with so much personality. Spike is cool, Ed fluffy, Faye feisty and Jet a boring old man but these are pretty one dimensional (with interesting backstories I guess). But nothing about them gripped me, maybe they were too ""ordinary"".
Enjoyment 7/10
Now I'll go into detail of what I enjoyed and didn't.
As mentioned briefly, the adventures are not that exciting besides Spike episodes. Luckily he got the most screen time. 
Then we hit episode 12 and everything became a little more interesting with Faye's back story just starting then my interest tailed off again. By episode 20 I was a bit discouraged to finish it. Due to its episodic nature you are literally judging episode by episode. One minute it's interesting next minute it's average. It depended on the character in focus a lot of the time. Spike and Faye would captivate me briefly then Jet and Ed would bore me (bar the mushroom episode with Ed was fun).
Although, it ended very strongly - Episode 24 left me with a weird feeling. Seeing that certain characters were potentially leaving made me feel sad. I can't remember when my attachment to them creeped up on me but it just did. The sound track had placed it's role perfectly.
So the last few episodes were great. Suddenly everyone opened up about their true feelings and suddenly the characters came to life. But it was too little too late, it was not worth all 26 episodes. I would have rather just watched Spike/Faye related episodes or a movie that summarised it all.
The Anime does very little wrong. It doesn't engage in fan service or annoying anime tropes. Everything feels authentic and true to itself. If you enjoy the characters interactions you will enjoy the episodic nature and that's the problem. It's episodic so there's no bigger story or world building to keep your imagination turning. There's nothing to get your heart racing, no complex theories to chew over, no back stories to pull your heart strings (wait Faye's nearly had me but they didn't go deep enough!). 
It's just every day life in space, well written with just the right amount of action. But I personally don't watch anime for this laid back sort of shows.Thus the wow factor didn't rub off on me. It didn't excite me enough. If I wasn't marathoning it, I doubt I won't anticipate an episode. I'll simply tune in if I had a spare moment.",7,abovetheveil,

                What did I think of Cowboy bebop... WELL down right one of my favorite anime's because of its outstanding work on adventure comedy and plots through each episode that always kept me entertained. When i first heard about the anime and its accusations of being one of the best anime's ever by some reviews I was curious about it, what brought me closer is that it was made around the time I myself was born.As I  saw this the plots of each different episode were always there keeping me watching it from begging to end with its awesome music (intro and outro)  written
                  by Yoko Kanno and performed by the Seatbelts that always had me hyped and so into it. I loved most every aspect of it and would recommend this amazing anime to any searching for a fun comedy, a badass sci fi, or some mystery type deal with a dramatic past. This anime deserves a 10 out of 10 (especially since it was made in 1998)",10,Deceipter,

FOREWORD:
For those of you who have grown up watching good anime your whole life, let me tell you a little secret: there was a time not all that long ago when translated, licensed episodes didn't exist in the U.S. This wasn't just because most people didn't know about it; in reality, the majority of Americans simply weren't interested. Cowboy Bebop changed all that. 
SUMMARY:
Of all the shows I've ever seen, this one takes the cake. Just because it's old doesn't mean you shouldn't watch
                  it- in fact, it's pretty difficult nowadays to find anything of a similar caliber amidst the never ending wave of eye-candy garbage that big name companies have begun to produce. 
Cowboy Bebop will lead you on an incredible adventure- one that is certainly full of tasteful humor and suspense, but also possesses an unexpected level of depth and meaning. It will draw you in gently with its art and sound, captivate you with its character development, and move your soul with its plot. 
The lighting, angles, and details in the art are unmatched. The music, too, is tasteful and unique, and compliments the atmosphere of each scene exquisitely. Every character is developed meaningfully throughout the show, and their distinct personalities are coordinated in a way that is both refreshing and endearing. 
This show will take your breath away. It will open up new vistas of thought, and leave you with a heart that better understands- if only a little- what it truly means to be human.",10,jdmills16,

                Cowboy bebop is, in my opinion the best show to ever air on television. It is one of 2 shows I think are perfect.
Story:10/10
 The story is unique and very creative. Most of it is told by flashbacks and you learn more about the past of the show as it goes along. It does it perfectly.
Art:10/10
 The art is amazing. Most old anime have an art style I don't really care for,(trigun for example.) but this is just awsome. The spaceships look unique, the character designs are wonderful, the way the drew everything is just awsome.
Sound:10/10
Nothing needs to be said here. Even if you haven't
                  seen this you have heard of the phenomenal soundtrack.
Character:10/10
The characters could not have been more perfect. Thayer are all likable, and the development on them is very impressive. As the show goes along, you learn more about their back stories that will make you appreciate them much more.

                When I read that Cowboy Bebop is an example of ""style over substance"" show, I am pretty confused. I enjoyed the show mainly for the depth of their characters, which seemed to me to be very adult and mature in an anime universe full of one-dimensional teenagers. Still Cowboy Bebop doesn't take itself too seriously and plays around with the unsolved problems, paranoias and insecurities of adult live a lot. The histories of the main characters are all well depicted and leave signs in their contemporary lives that can't be completely ignored. The past traumas and life long struggles are shown in detail and evoke
                  a great focus on human's complexity.
The atmosphere, the tone, the mood of Cowboy Bebop is incredible. Taking elements from exploration sci-fi, western, and noir it creates a stunningly dark and slightly melancholic show perfectly in sync with the jazz pieces of the soundtrack. I feel a great sense of taste in everything while watching Cowboy Bebop. This while still having a great sense of humor which makes the show so enjoyable and not only focus on heavy psychological themes. I think the blending of the different genres and elements of western and japanese culture is perfectly balanced, thus creating something new which hasn't been seen before. The show was promoted by the producers by the motto ""a new genre unto itself"". It is naturally an exaggeration, but it does contain an element of truth. Instead of focusing totally on japanese drawn elements this show goes far beyond and creates an opera magnum which even Film as a medium has difficulties to achieve, being restricted in rules of the genres. Few directors have been able to transcend these limits and I believe Cowboy Bebop is considered a classic also for its ability to mix different elements coherently and beautifully. 
But honestly I believe this is not enough to create a masterpiece. The CULT of this show is delivered by interesting combination of before contradictory or too-different elements while thematizing universal problems such as existentialism, loneliness, ethics. Friendship and relationship to other people is depicted in such great detail you surely will find something to see yourself into. 
Long story short, Cowboy Bebop is not only style over substance. Thematic elements are incredibly deep and mature thus making it an unique experience. A classic.",10,Moerbeck,

                This is one of those series that most people will rave about. Across the board, you will find that most people will recommend this series. I am going to not be one of those people, per se. Cowboy Bebop is worth watching, but there are things about it that some might not find so fun. The characters for the most part are good, I have some issues with Spike and Faye personally, but overall they're likable. The music is wonderful, alone warranting a look into the soundtrack. I think what turns me off, a little, is the lack of a continuous plot, which does work
                  for this and some other series, but not others. It DOES work for Cowboy Bebop, but it throws a lot of what to expect up in the air, which can be exciting but can also leave very little to expect. And I will say this, depressing could be an accurate summation of the series overall. I won't say that a series or something shouldn't make you sad or should always have a happy ending, but to me that just rounds out a good story so well. I don't like being built up to be let down at the end, and Cowboy Bebop did that to me a bit.

                Cowboy Bebop - The futuristic calamities and tragedies of a carefree bounty hunter and his companions. If you haven't seen it, you better get to it! The blend and implications of this space drama is loaded with great humor and action, not to mention the art style for it's day was nonparallel. If I were a wine connoisseur, and this show was a wine, it would be the vintage among the collection.

                Cowboy Bebop is an amazing anime.  The series itself is about 85% episodic, meaning that each episode is a stand alone story.  Only a few episodes follow a certain 'overall' story arc, which involves Spike's past and someone who used to be his friend, who has now turned into his bitter enemy.  Spike (the main character) slowly reveals his past through short flashbacks and dream sequences.  What truly happens in his past is never fully explained and is left open for the viewer to interpret.
All episodes are unique and interesting.  Some may involve getting a bounty and catching a wanted
                  criminal while others may be about something as simple as beating a genius at chess.  The randomness of the episodes and the story that each one tells makes Cowboy Bebop original, unpredictable, and entertaining.
The character designs in this series are extremely well done.  Each character looks very detailed in appearance and is unique in personalities and character traits.  The animation is also very impressive and reaches a point that Cowboy Bebop can be compared to anime that have been released recently.  This is an impressive feat considering that it was released in 1998.
The soundtrack is also one of the best I have ever heard.  Cowboy Bebop is my second favorite in terms of music, second only to FLCL.  The jazz influence can be found in multiple episodes and plays an important role in the overall tone of the series.  From the fast paced opening 'Tank!' to the well suited and stylized music played in certain scenes (falling from a church window, chasing a criminal, jazz and blues played at a local lounge, etc.), and the critically acclaimed ending song 'The Real Folk Blues,' the music isn't just 'there' but adds to the anime as a whole and to some fans, the music defines Cowboy Bebop.  Even the episode titles are named after songs or musical components.
Cowboy Bebop also has a certain style that is hard to describe.  From all of the anime that I have seen, this is one of a kind and can't be imitated (although Samurai Champloo comes close).  Every setting is astonishing and easy on the eyes.  There are high class space casinos, freezing cold planets with lowly criminals, futuristic cities with skyscrapers, and even barren deserts filled with nothing but sand.  Each new location provides a new 'feel' that defines that episode.  This anime also provides so many genre types that it is hard to classify.  In some ways, Cowboy Bebop is a genre in of itself.  It can be lightly humored like 'Mushroom Samba,' melancholy and depressing like 'Waltz for Venus,' action oriented and story driven like 'The Real Folk Blues parts 1 and 2,' and simply brilliant like 'Ballad of Fallen Angels.'  This anime offers so much that it can appeal to ANY kind of anime fan.  If you blend incredible music, visuals, stories, and settings, you end up with nothing but the essence of Cowboy Bebop's style.
By the last two episodes, Spike finally catches up to his ex-friend turned bitter rival and fights to bring peace to himself for what has happened in the past.  The ending is so dramatic, well done, and overwhelming, that it is my favorite anime ending of all time.  The ending is well deserved for the series and brings this awesome series to a stunning conclusion.

                Well, that was all over the place. I think I finally ''got'' this series just about the time I finished it... maybe, I mean, I now kinda get how it's great and unique in a way. That there's a reason it's held in high regards. But I can't ignore that I was pretty much bored by at least a third of it. What I disliked about it: old production means it's slow. Seriously, 120-130% seems like natural playback speed in most cases. It's very episodic, and one of things I most like about serious anime is that they're often not episodic. 
However, it's hard to
                  call Bebop serious. At times it's downright trolling the viewer, similar as Champloo (also by Watanabe). Troll moments and episodes were probably my favorite parts as I felt they were comical and really effective given the setting. Then there are many ''serious'' episodes that just cover some minor side story, and I found most of them boring. Most of them would provide some minor character or plot development and rely on rule of cool a lot, as nearly all action is spectacle, often with troll physics included. Not in TTGL sense, but not too far either. It takes some getting used to since setting and style appear quite serious/real. 
Then there are episodes that really develop and explore a particular character, and even episodes that explore serious topics and cover them surprisingly well. I felt that characters took forever to develop, which resulted in me only feeling attached to them by the time of ending episodes. Naturally, it made me enjoy the last third of the anime more, and pretty great ending only adds to it. Animation is great for its time, but it's really aged and I can't say I didn't mind. I think I would have enjoyed it much more if it was less episodic, picked up the pace, cut out a third of the episodes, and switch focus from being all over the place to comedy, at least in earlier episodes. It's similar to Champloo in many ways, but I definitely liked Champloo better.",7,Eagleshadow,

                This short review reflects my honest opinion about this show, I don't intend to spark a flame war with it and I'm writing simply my sincere thoughts about this series.
Cowboy Bebop is an anime that has been long since praised and is regarded as a cornerstone of Japanese animation, unfortunately, the show didn't struck me as impressive in spite of having watched it more than twice over the years. 
Story: 3
The story is set in the year 2071 and revolves around bounty hunters, specifically Spike Spiegel and his ""partner"", Jet Black, who make a living by chasing criminals of the solar system, later on, the
                  crew grows larger thanks to the voluptuous Faye Valentine and the skilled hacker Edward.
The plot doesn't show any sign of plot progress until the fifth episode, where Spike's former friend and nemesis, Vicious is introduced, however, the plot of the various episodes fluctuates between linear bounty hunting and secondary or rather silly episodes that barely bear any significant change to the story, this is exactly what disappointed me the most, in fact, the show could be summed up in three or more episodes, perhaps I'm being hyperbolic here, but twelve episodes could have worked just as well. Frankly, episodes like ""Mushroom Samba"" bore me to death no matter how many times I rewatched the show, the fact is that Cowboy Bebop is full of these kind of episodes, hence forcing myself to watch it took me several efforts, as it goes without saying that it wasn't easy.
Art: 7
The animation doesn't belong in the trash, but neither is anything stunning from my point of view, although it makes the show enjoyable, there's not much to say about it.
Sound: 8
Music is one of the strongest points of the series, I always appreciate Yoko Kanno's works and the songs she composed for this show are no exception, almost every song in the show is worthy of being called memorable, as you'll probably wish to listen to the soundtrack at least once in your life.
Character: 5
It's unfortunate the characters don't match my taste at all, I guess I just can't relate to any of them or found them utterly generic, I like Spike, he's a cool and skilled guy and everything, but it doesn't get deeper than that, even after his backstory was explained along with Jet Black's and Faye's, it didn't impress me in the slightest, the characters are still cliched to the core from the beginning to the end of the anime, thus I can't help but say that I disliked them.
Enjoyment: 6
I always believed that if might have watched the show back when it came out, I would've enjoyed it much more. In my opinion, Cowboy Bebop has aged and nowadays it can't be regarded as a masterpiece as back then. 
I prefer shows like Darker than Black or Dimension W over it, while the two aren't as praised as much as Bebop, they don't feel nearly as generic as it. I enjoyed the ending which took a very unique turn for the better, but all I can say about Cowboy Bebop is that it's an okay show, and doesn't deserve the praise it gets.
Overall: 5
From my previous experiences, I have a hunch that I'm going to anger the fandom. be labelled as a troll or a person with considerably ""shit taste"" one way or the other, but it doesn't influence my thoughts about the show. I didn't enjoy Cowboy Bebop, but I could have enjoyed it if I watched it in the age it came out. This brief review only describes my subjective opinion and is in no way meant to offend somebody.",5,azoth212,

                This was one of my first anime ever. (not counting Pokemon and Digimon) After years I decided to rewatch and it was totally worth it. I missed so many things before. 
Almost everyone get caught by Spike Spiegel. I doubt that there is a cooler character in any other anime. When you finish this anime, you'll feel a need to just walk around with hands in your pockets and disinterested face. During the whole anime we can see some flashbacks and hints about his past but the main thought comes in the two final episodes which are truly epic. Not epic like American action films
                  but epic for the simplicity of the ending.
But it would be such a pity not to mention all the other characters, every with a unique personal story. To be honest I think I don't know any other anime with better characters and their background. 
Jet, cool-looking bounty hunter cooperating with Spike and acting a bit like a boss or even like an older brother to everyone on his ship. Faye, a girl who lost her memory and comes from a long time ago. She's acting cool and self-assured but then you realise that it's just a mask to hide her real face of someone who doesn't really know where he belongs and who maybe finally found something like home. Ein, genial dog (kinda cute one :D) and Ed. Hehe looks like it's she but none can say for sure. I can guarantee that you will be looking forward to every scene with Ed, they are really hilarious.
During the whole series we follow this bunch hunting villains as their job and I gotta say that some episodes are really deep. No fantasy, no fairy tale, just life as it is. 
But life is just a dream in the end....",10,iHitokage,

                First review; bear with me. Now I'm sure this anime has been done to death, but reviewing it was irresistible since it was one of the first animes I watched, thus making a pretty lasting impression on me. Cowboy Bebop provided an extremely smooth transition from familiar American cartoons to a literally foreign arena. This show takes action to a new level, with a plethora of heart palpitating adventures which not only delve into the blatant physical aspects of the characters and setting, but the development of interpersonal relationships amongst them.
For those unfamiliar with Cowboy Bebop, the entire show is essentially the prologue to a
                  main story that the audience never explicitly discovers. That being said, there are ups and downs to this plot set up. One of the more commendable aspects is the show's lack of straightforward obviousness in several areas, despite apparent inter-galactic shootouts and dog fights. This is especially noted in the character development of Spike and Faye, as well as the bond between them. At first glance, Spike is your stereotypical uninterested protagonist emitting a cool aura, while Faye is a rogue heroine bad ass– if you will. You would expect a fairly predictable relationship between them following the lines of an abrupt love forming... Yadda yadda. However, a more subtle form of trust and understanding blossoms between them not through cheesy confessions, or transparent words, but exhilarating action! What better way to convey love is there?
That being said, predictability isn't necessarily a bad thing. Mind-numbing action probably isn't the ideal form of entertainment for some of you more analytic audiences, but the simplicity of the show made it easy to follow and more enjoyable. Missing an episode won't leave you puzzled and without important information, since you're basically guaranteed a complete adventure every episode, which leads me to my last point.
The creators of Cowboy Bebop went a little far with the whole idea of it being a prologue, and in certain instances, there were a lot of cases of ambiguity. The three main characters of course are given some sort of backstory, however not all of it was logically explained. For example, Spike's relationship with the main villain is described as once being on the same side, and now they hate each other, but not how exactly they got to that point. 
Overall Cowboy Bebop has minor issues, but they certainly don't overshadow the immense entertainment, and joy the show brings to any audience. An excellent starter anime, and timeless classic.",10,nolifesenpai,

                Cowboy Bebop is a show that no matter how many times I watch it, it never gets old. The characters are all unique and add their own ""pizzazz"" to the fantastic story. That, along with the beautiful artwork and soundtrack that's catchy as all get out make this one of my top five animes.

                Shinichiro Watanabe's undoubtedly most successful series of all time. Cowboy bebop originally aired on Japanese television in-between April and June of 1998 but in Australia were I live originally came out in 2007 airing on ABC2. Cowboy Bebop is a series that everyone has seen and has gathered major success especially in the west garnering a reputation amongst anime fans as one of the great ""Classics"". Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime I was ever exposed to, up until meeting the titular bebop crew I had never taken anime seriously, or how I looked at them cartoons. Cowboy bebop introduced me to a
                  mature side of media I had never experienced before. 
~The Q and A.~
1. Q. Should you watch Cowboy Bebop?
A. This is most definitely a yes. Cowboy Bebop is a series that anyone can watch and enjoy, you don't have to like Sci-fi, you don't have to like Noir and you don't have to like Action. Cowboy Bebop appeals to all audiences. Like Baccano! Cowboy bebop oozes the same western vibes that make it a good anime for beginners to get into. Cowboy bebop undoubtedly is made for a more mature audience who will pick up on the more subtle themes, but Younger audiences can still enjoy bebop, even if your not watching bebop for the subtle themes and messages then it's still a fun action packed ride.
~Review Portion~
[Story 8/10]
Cowboy Bebop follows the adventures and sometimes (most of the time) the Misadventures of a small crew of space bounty hunters. Bebop is presented in an episodic way which isn't a bad thing, this just means some of the episodes are gonna be a hit or miss. But with that being said when an episode hits it fucking hits harder than Mike Tyson for example . Session 10, Ganymede Elegy. Jet lands on Ganymede for the first time since he left 8 years ago and he's going to find his former lover/Ex girlfriend, Elisa. Jet is held back by his past (This is a theme between basically every character) and has come back to mend his wrongs and find out why Elisa left him. Up until this episode the crew had faced their fair share of tragedy. But episode 10 for me was the saddest tragedy, It's an episode so vividly engrained into my head and I'll never forget Jet's words.
Another example of an episode that hit would be my actual favourite episode of cowboy bebop ever. Session 5, Ballad of Fallen Angels is probably the best written episode of all time, Spike haunted by his past faces a former comrade and friend from the Syndicate, Vicious. Already from the start the episode was set out to be a good one, They drop the bombshell that Spike is a former member of the Red Dragon Syndicate and when a bounty is put out on a syndicate boss Spike goes to repay an old debt. Ballad fo the fallen angels is endlessly cool and it's the first time we get to see spike's past to such a capacity, before then we knew almost nothing about spike and it's great because we get to see into spikes past. Ballad of the Fallen Angels is the beginnings to some other great episodes like The Real Folk Blues. Ganyemede Elegy and Ballad of the Fallen Angels are amongst a seas of other great episodes, like the aforementioned Real Folk Blue's, Asteroid Blue's, Waltz for Venus, Jupiter Jazz and Speak Like a child. Of course with so many hits there are bound to be Misses (Heavy Metal Queen, Boogie-Woogie Feng-Shui) But overall Cowboy Bebop has good stories, stories that can stand on there own as self contained events.
[Art 9/10]
Looking back at Cowboy Bebop the art work and animation are still as good as ever, after 22 years since it originally aired Cowboy Bebop still doesn't look a day old. The animation is pure sakuga, especially during the incredible fight scenes. The character designs are all pretty damn iconic and the art is one of the stand out features.
[Sound 10/10]
Cowboy Bebop has one of the most iconic soundtracks of all time, the OST is made by the Seatbelts, which was created by the legend Yoko Kanno herself. The soundtrack is a space western kinda feel Tracks like waltz for zizi or Too Good Too Bad are classically jazzy or western, while others such as Cat on Mars elicit the more sci-fi elements of the story.  Tank is such an amazing opening it's endlessly jazzy and has some of the best visuals. 
Now I haven't seen the sub to Cowboy Bebop but I have seen the dub and the dub is absolutely brilliant, it's one of the few anime dubs that surpasses the sub. Steve Blums amazing voice made Spike one of the most iconic characters of all time Beau Billingslea as the voice of Jet is incredible. The rest of the english dub cast is just incredible solid so I would definitely recommend the dub of the series to anyone who wants to watch cowboy bebop.
[Character 10/10]
The characters are the best part of cowboy bebop. Our central cast of Spike, Faye, Edward and Jet are a lot of fun to watch, they all have unique character traits that seperate them from each other. They're all in some capacity haunted by there past experiences and watching them struggle to deal with the past is what makes it so good. Spike is a fun badass, but because of his past with the Red Dragon Syndicate he can't escape his past and is always being followed by it. Jet is the straight man, he's the one who takes control amidst the madness of the other members, but he's also a former cop and because of his time as a cop there's always some new thing popping up about his old line of work. Faye is the sleazy girl who deceives guys, but she also lost her memory and woke up in a world she didn't have any idea about. And Ed is this wacky entertaining computer nerd and genius. she doesn't let her past affect how she views the world. The character on the bebop are always a fun and welcome bunch. Some of the one off characters and some recurring characters are a nice sight to see. 
The Villains are always fun, one off villains such as Mad Pierrot and Fad are fun to watch. But Vicious is the Creme De La Creme, he is not only Interesting and fun but he is the direct cause for the most interesting conflict in the entire show, that being Spike and Vicious's relationship as former partner's in the syndicate. Vicious is probably the most important part of the story and has such a huge presence in the story.
[Overall + Enjoyment 9/10]
Cowboy Bebop is an endlessly cool and fun anime, it has some of the best visuals, animation, voice acting and writing to be found in any anime and it's one of those must watch anime that anyone who is even this slightest bit interested in the medium must watch. My overall on this is a 9/10.",9,SynthwaveCrusade,

                Cowboy Bebop: asteroid blues and cats on mars (minor spoilers)
All good things must come to an end, whether they be shows, summers, or even friendships. But that doesn't mean those things didn't matter, and that certainly doesn't mean many more good things won't follow. That just means you're living in the real world. 
From the opening scene, Cowboy Bebop leaves a tinge of sadness; a bouquet of crumpled flowers, hailing rain and a man regretfully leaving it all behind. Bebop presents an array of complex themes yet provides simple and satisfying answers, whilst doing it in a jazzy and stylistically innovative manner. 
“I’m not going
                  there to die, I’m going to see if I’m truly alive.”
Spike, as best stated by himself, is a living ghost. Once a man who found identity in his gang, friends and his woman, Spike lost it all and is left with a heavy soul and a weight to carry. An old comrade resurfaces as a villain, mocking and taunting him, tearing at old wounds and calling upon great emotions of anger and regret. Cowboy bebop plays with Spike’s lost identity and his obsession with the past subtlety, displaying a façade of an easy-going, all-knowing cowboy, yet flashing uncertainty and melancholy in the sheen of his miscoloured eyes. Cowboy Bebop’s master stroke is the expertise juggling of light-hearted, fun bounty hunting and the tragic, regretful pasts of the main cast which is always there, in the shadow of the various adventures the crew embarks on. The viewer knows it’s there, yet they are able to appreciate the fun, nonsensical moments all the same. As a show of multiple identities, reflected in the cast, cowboy bebop can be seen as a genre of it’s own. 
The characters aboard the Bebop truly have character (although they may lack an affirming identity). Their intense races to score each bounty, playful jeering and mopey shenanigans evoke all the feelings one could possibly feel; pure joy and excitement, yet deep inside, as Cowboy Bebop so expertly portrays, the feeling of melancholy. The characters, as well as they mesh and bounce off each other, have all left something behind and are simply living with regret. Faye copes with becoming disconnected from everything and everyone she ever cared for, not being able to grow up and experience the real youth she was meant to, Jet copes with his unintentional selfishness  leading to his woman leaving, and Spike copes with being betrayed by a good friend and losing the love of his life. Yet, as subtlely as Cowboy Bebop portrays melancholy, it also tells us that everything will be alright, that if even this rag-tag group of vagabonds can come together, then maybe they did find something real. That despite losing all external links to identity, there is always the possibility of finding more meaning in life. 
Cowboy Bebop’s structure may be as complex as it’s themes, it’s an episodic show with a few episodes which depict the cast’s overarching stories. While many episodes have something to say, some are just pure, unfiltered fun. Some instil great fear and terror, others inspire friendship and love. In the background, the past lives of the characters methodically unravel, presenting only the necessary information. Blink once and you could miss it all! The viewer can take Cowboy Bebop as shallow or as complex as they want, it’s truly an enjoyment for everyone. It even blares every type of music you could like: heavy metal, Japanese pop, lounge, swing, chorale and scat-singing, among other styles, as well as the usual blues and jazz pieces. Whether it’s a slow, romantic drink in a bar or a thrilling ship-chase, the music only adds and never subtracts. It pulls you into a thrilling symphony of visuals, sounds and excitement, many times evoking great synaesthesia. The stunning art and animation cannot be discredited either, inspiring great awe or intimacy in the vastness of space. Cowboy Bebop blends all of the classic Anime elements together with multicultural influence and innovative sound design, truly inventing a genre of its own. 
The motif of dreams is often repeated by Spike and crew, that sometimes life seems like a dream, and only now that the past has departed that they feel awake. Take this as you will, but I believe that it’s telling us to keep moving forward, that time is unrelenting. In its cathartic finale, some of Bebop’s characters move on, and some don’t. Whatever your choice, you’ll forever carry the weight of the past; but don’t let that weigh down your future.

                Cowboy bebop is a very rare anime in the sense that there really isn't too much to the story, yet it is still a very entertaining and enjoyable series. It's is just about the only anime where the english dub is probably better than the japanese language version. On a personal note though, I enjoyed the Cowboy Bebop movie a little more than the show.
Definitely worth watching multiple times.

                Right, so here's the thing. I have been told to watch this anime as one of the classics, and I will give it the fact that it is alright, but I also think it is massively overrated.
One of my biggest problems with the show is that you can watch the first 3 then last 2 episodes and it is still consistent as if the 20ish episodes in between did not even happen. 
The characters, music, and animation are all wonderful and I will praise it for that, but the show itself leaves little to no impact on me. I will probably be getting a lot
                  of ""not helpful"" reviews here because I will not be writing about any spoilers.
Some of the comedy in the show is enjoyable and somewhat make up for the fact that it takes so long to do what it does.
The reason why this anime scores so low for me is because it feels unnecessarily long and the pay off for the last two episodes was just straight up not worth it in my mind after sitting through some of the painstakingly boring episodes.
It's an alright anime, it does not sit even close to the top of my recommendations, but it is a top recommendation for many others. Watch it if you want to, but this anime is just not the best and is the first anime I am writing a full review for because I know I stand in the minority when I say that this anime is really just okay.",6,zeus043,

                Cowboy Bebop was not the first anime I had ever watched, which looking back probably hurt my enjoyment of the series. I had been spoiled with other action/drama series that had a much better flow to the overall story, Trigun being a prime example. Cowboy Bebop for the most part scatters plot important episodes around the series, most others being ether filler or character focused. Now I'm not complaining about filler episodes, I to a certain extent I love them since they can take more liberties to be unique in various ways. My gripe is with character-focused episodes, because they're so boring I had to
                  attempt to watch a few of them more than once not having the care to finish it the first time. The problem is that these episodes are slow, usually take up most of the screen time with just a single main character, and have an addiction to flashbacks / somber moments. It's not the worlds biggest problem, there are only about 5 episodes like this, and 2 others that are debatably so it's not a capital offence.
I mostly only have good things left to say about the show, and if you've heard anything about it you already know what I'm going to say. The animation is exceedingly good, hand drawn and beautiful. The jazz soundtrack is iconic and is frequently compared to others that are like it. Most of the characters are memorable and interesting (excluding Ed, I have zero clue why people like her).
As a closing I'll give both a compliment and a criticism. I really liked episodes that kept the amount of science fiction elements to a minimum, not talking about space ship type stuff, I mean uploading souls to the internet. The show is at it's best when it keeps it's noir feel and collapses when it goes Star Trek. Most episodes sticks to the noir, but every once in a while you feel like you put on the wrong series.",7,Objectivity_jk,

                Cowboy Bebop. Wow. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Instead of just writing a straightforward review, let me tell you WHY this is probably in my top 3 anime series of all time.
-It's got interesting characters
-The fight scenes are choreographed so well and the jazz-like music in the background mixes so well with the mood
-It has a fairly non-linear plot, so many of the episodes could be watched on their own without missing any important information from the previous episode
-It's got an amazing ending, perhaps one of the best of all time
-It doesn't ever take itself too seriously, but at the same
                  time never attempts to be campy.
-The music tends to be awesome
-A large variety of different episodes; from the serious nature of the last two episodes to the goofy nature of the mushroom episode
I could go on. Let me just end with this: this was one of the first serious anime series that I ever watched (was about 13 or so when I first saw CB) and is still  is one of my all-time favorite series.
Bottom line: check out Cowboy Bebop if you haven't. There's a good chance that you'll find at least one thing from this show that you'll really like.",10,ironcladgranite,

                Cowboy bebop is an anime that was written by Keiko Nobumoto in 1998. The story takes place in the year 2071 follows what starts off as a pair of bounty hunters named Spike and Jet who travel aboard the spacecraft 'bebop'.  As the series progresses, their group quickly grows to five with the addition of the data dog Ein, an odd woman named Faye Valentine and a little girl named Edward, who seems to be the brains of the operation while still being totally childish.Technically speaking, out of Bebop's twenty six episodes, only five of them have any plot element to them, the rest
                  are totally episodic. These one episode stand-alones can range from incredibly silly (Mushroom samba) to incredibly deep and sad (Perriot de fou). However, no matter what, every episode strives to add something to one, or even all of our main characters. Bebop certainly shines most when it's exploring the actual plot, but these episodes wouldn't shine as much if they hadn't spent so much time giving depth to the characters. The actual plot of the show is about Spike's feud with a man named Vicious. I won't dive much further into details, as to not to spoil, though. It finally concludes with what is rightfully known as one of the most fitting ends to an anime series. 
Now we'll touch on the characters. It's impossible not to love someone in the main cast. They are all very well developed and loveable characters. From the cool and thoughtful Jet to the odd and off the wall Edward, there's always someone to love. Spike himself is also a great character, however, I'm sure most people have heard enough about how cool he is, and although it's true, I shan't go on about it any more than that. Faye is a real femme fatale and a very strong female character that is very independent, but can also come off as rather cold and selfish, and she is. She is also often as foolish as Spike, can also match him in terms of bravery. Ed's weird, that much is certain, but it doesn't make her annoying, her brand of weird just makes her more likeable, which is something not so easily pulled off. As mentioned, Spike is cool, foolish, brave and stubborn. He is also intelligent when he needs to be, but likes to wallow in the past even when he tells others not to. Jet is a strong leader of the group, who often keeps the group together and keeps them from hurting themselves. Without him, who knows how much more trouble the crew would get in. Overall, bebop has an outstanding cast of characters, among whom you will find at least one character to love.
The animation is another great point for bebop. This show was made over ten years ago, but the animation matches up to the best of the best today. It's clear how much effort went into every frame. The characters have large (although not as large as some anime) eyes that display strong emotions, but for the most part, the characters look and move much like real humans. The animals are also probably some of the more realistic animals seen in animation. They look and move more like actual animals rather than cartoons.  
What do we all know about bebop? The music of course! Bebop's soundtrack fits so masterfully with the show that it is impossible to ignore and impossible to forget. The oddest songs play at the most seemingly out of place of times and really have no business working as well as they always do. The music in Cowboy bebop is always spot-on and never misses, ever. Yoko Kanno always does a great job, another example of her work being the score in Wolf's rain, which was also created by Keiko Nobumoto. Oddly enough, though, the soundtrack listened to without the show just isn't quite the same. The music needs the show to be effective, but when paired with the show, it is just that, very effective. It is also a mix of so many different genres, most prominent being Jazz, but there are also many other genres mixed in here and there. The opening (Tank) and ending (The Real folk blues) credits are also a force to be reckoned with, both fitting the series extremely well and you never want to skip them. Both of them are extremely well done and probably some of the best in anime. 
The voice acting, although strong in Japanese, is a treat to watch in English. The English voice actors really breathe new life into their characters. The main example of this being Melissa Charles as Edward. She is the one who makes Edward so loveable. She made her odd personality charming rather than annoying, which the Japanese voice actor didn't quite do. Of course, everyone in the English cast is top-notch and you should definitely watch this one in English, Edward just needed special mention.
Overall, while Bebop's premise may not be entirely original, the execution is outstanding, it's an exciting show with a lot to offer. It can and will be enjoyed by just about anyone. It's one and only shortcoming is the fact that the story is episodic for the most part, which may turn some people off, but this is overcome with a strong cast, amazing visuals and a breathtaking musical score, along with the fact that when the plot of the story shows up, it is even more exciting than the stand alones that were great to begin with. This show simply cannot be compared to anything in existence.",10,Thefrozentundra,

                This is the show that started it all for me, I was never really that interested in Japanese animation, with the exception of shows like Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh (but what kid didn't watch these shows?).
The very first thing that caught my eye (or rather my ears) was the music. Jazz was something I never really understood or liked, but the first time I heard those dynamic notes in the opening, I was hooked. Furthermore, the dubbing was great, I usually find that the English voice actors can never quite capture the same feeling that the Japanese voice actors could. It still remains one of the
                  only shows I watched dubbed. I never found a reason to watch the Japanese version, especially since the show reflects a lot of Western influence.
The story, although disjointed, still offered me the perspectives and philosophies of the characters. Character development is never ignored in the plot, and you get sucked into the perceptions and feelings of the antagonists and even the minor characters. Sure, you want to root for the protagonists, but never at any point do you see the characters as truly black and white. They all have their motives and meaning. 
For its time, the art and animation was fantastic; the grand scenery, the fluid movements, mature character designs, as well as the ambiance set a new standard for me at the time. I've probably watched this show half a dozen times, and even in recent memory, I never thought that the needed to be remade or updated.
I still listen to ""The Real Folk Blues"" every now and then.",9,fivefourtytwo,

                First, I'd like to say that Cowboy Bebop is a very good anime. Some of you are probably wondering why I gave it a 7 if I thought it was so good.  There are two reasons. First, it is too episodic for my tastes. And I don't know the second one. I've tried and tried to put into words my other reason for not giving it a higher rating but I just don't know how to say it. There is something off about this anime that I can't pinpoint and it prevents me from giving this anime a higher score. I have never been
                  so conflicted about an anime in my life. 
Background & Brief Overview: 
Before I started this anime, I read the synopsis and thought it was really interesting to have a western/space mix. It reminded me of Stephen King's book series The Dark Tower which combines Western with science fantasy. The anime is about a group of bounty hunters that travel around space catching criminals, discovering and fighting their pasts. At first, there are two members of this hapless group: Spike Spiegel, a former hitman, and his friend Jet Black, a former ISSP officer. Later, a computer hacker, Edward, and con artist, Faye, and a data dog, Ein, join the group. The anime is very episodic. Basically, it's a bunch of events that happen to this group put together in a series with a one major overarching plot. Throughout the series, the pasts of the crew are explored. 
It took me my entire sophomore year of college to finish this anime. Besides the fact that I was busy with school, I had no real drive to watch this anime. The show was so episodic that I wouldn't need to refresh my memory when I got back to it. Normally, if I found the anime interesting, I would start and finish relatively quickly. For example, during my freshman year, I finished Death Note in a week. I couldn't do that with Cowboy Bebop because it didn't pique my interest from the very beginning. The art and sound were really good. The sound really complemented the animation. 
A Closer Look:
Where Cowboy Bebop makes its mark is making anime appealing and enjoyable to the Western culture. It references many Western movies. If you have seen many classic Western films, you will recognize the references instantly, I personally did not get any of the references because I haven't seen many classic Westerns. As far as action goes, this anime is the cream of the crop. The action sequences are done beautifully and are meant to recall the mixed martial arts films of back in the day. 
An In-Depth Analysis:
Although it may not seem like it amid the crazy story-line, everything in Cowboy Bebop is done for a reason. The characters are bounty hunters, an occupation that has long periods of boredom followed by brief intensity. The episodic nature of the show conveys this beautifully as the characters go months without any significant altercations. All the characters are running from something in their past. To do this, they need to be occupied by something. Ironically, the crew travels through vast spaces of nothingness which produced an unbearable ennui and as a result they are forced to confront their pasts. 
Another theme that is prevalent in the show is dreams. There are so many references to dreams in the show. Spike himself doesn't know whether he is in a dream or this is reality. The fact that this all could be a dream is reflected in Spike's nonchalant attitude and his hobby: sleeping. 
Lastly, the anime explores the power of one's past. Every character tries to run from the past but it somehow comes back and affects their future. With all the traveling and running the characters do, they can't run from their past suggesting that one's past is inescapable. Ii is a part of who you are and who you will be.

The Critical Critic",7,flashair,
1,"
                I was kind of disappointed with this series. I didn't really know anything about it going in, but it'd been hyped up by a friend of mine and it's one of the ""classic anime"" that many people seem to love, so I had high expectations.
I think a big issue for me with the series is the episodic nature of it. It got pretty repetitive with many episodes having the general premise of ""Here's this week's criminal. How will the team catch him/her and collect the bounty?"" While most of the episodes were still entertaining to watch, I would've liked there to be a more cohesive
                  overarching plot. The climax of the series is built up over only a few episodes and kind of comes out of nowhere, like it was just thrown in to end the series.
The lack of a cohesive overarching plot fits the characters, but it doesn't make the most enjoyable story, imo. I don't want to give too many details to avoid spoilers, but to put it simply, the episodic nature of the series fits the characters taking things one day at a time and not necessarily moving toward a certain goal. I can appreciate that parallelism/artistic decision, but it doesn't make the series more enjoyable for me.
Despite it being pretty dated at this point, I enjoyed the art style. I'd even say the dated animation/art style works in favor of the series because it fits the ""Western"" vibe of the show.
The sound was really good. I watched the first couple episodes dubbed and the rest subbed and thought the voice acting was good in both of them. I think the voices fit the characters well, but there was a voice or two that really annoyed me. I really liked the music too, especially the OP.
I liked the characters, and I think they each received sufficient character development. Throughout the series, you get hints about the characters' backstories sprinkled into certain episodes and near the end of the series, each of them gets an episode or two dedicated to their backstories and what led to them being in their current position.",7,fredericouno,

                Ok listen, this is really hard for me to do. Growing up I had a very negative opinion on anime and pretty much refused to take part in anything that came from japan aside from Mario games and occasional handfuls of pocky. But due to quarantine going far longer than anyone could have expected, and the fact watching Parks and Rec for the 10th time isn’t considered “mentally fulfilling,” I had the choice between giving anime a chance or trying to hibernate in the freezer until this corona thing blew over. At first I chose the latter, only changing my mind when my brother baited
                  me out of the freezer with the promises of jazz, fist fights, spaceships, existential questions… and more pocky.
Even though I was disappointed by the lack of pocky I can definitely say Cowboy Bebop provided exactly what was promised and then some. Making me feel genuine emotions of joy, sorrow, confusion, acceptance, and what I like to call… “the big sad”... twice. Let me just say I’ll probably never eat eggs again without shedding at least a single tear. What I’m trying to say in this fever based rant is that Cowboy Bebop grasped me emotionally in a way I haven’t felt since I decided to spend sophomore summer binging Breaking Bad. The show is exceptionally well written, perfectly voice acted (in the dub surprisingly), endlessly entertaining, and emotionally fulfilling in more ways than one. If you are an anime fan and still haven’t watched this show, then please do so. And if you were like me, constantly pushing anime aside as entertainment for weirdos, this show is specifically made to convince you that you're wrong. See you space cowboys.",10,QuiteAshraf,
1,"
                Cowboy Bebop has been, since it's release in 1998, the bar by which every new anime series is judged by. It's just that good. Many have described it as 1970's cop show-meets western-meets high-quality drama-meets film-noir, and I am gonna have to agree with them.
Cowboy Bebop revolves around futuristic bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black, and the series is really just their exploits through the universe. Along the way, they meet female bounty hunter Faye Valentine, computer hacker Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky 4th (simply Ed for short), data dog Ein, and various bounties and figures from their past.
The beauty of Cowboy Bebop is
                  that although the show does have a recurring story based around Spike's past, this is more or less tossed aside for ""filler"" episodes, or one episode storylines. Through filler episodes, we make a very strong bond and attachment to these characters, and it makes the ending to it all the more heartfelt.
When I watch Cowboy Bebop, I really do feel what happens to the characters. You feel sympathy and plight, happiness and joy, sadness and sorrow. You care about the characters, and I commend the staff who worked on the series for doing this. Very few anime series have characters for whom you can actually relate to, build bonds to emotionally, and frankly, give a damn about. Cowboy Bebop pulls it off with elegance and grace, as if it were nothing.
All in all, Cowboy Bebop is one of the best anime ever created, hands down. it has excellent characters, wonderful storylines, beautiful animation, and mesmorizing locales. It remains to be one of my favorites of all time.",10,renegadeviking,

                This anime called ""Cowboy Bebop"" is a very funny and quite well illustrated show that includes hilarious characters and also very bureaucratic characters, but as in bounty hunters.
 The anime has a somewhat a good plot leading off with random skits of funniness and back to the main story, the art style is an old crisp style and I would have to say it matches the type of show that it is.
 The sound was fine with the vehicles / shootings / etc., Some of the characters sound very weird at first but then you'll get used to their voice.
 The characters all have very
                  different types of personalities, they have a funny / serious type to all the characters in the story.
 I very much enjoyed the whole thing, and I would have to give the whole thing a 9.
 I really hope you enjoy reading this review and have a good day!

                The Cowboy Bebop series is about the adventures of a spaceship called the Bebop and its crew of bounty hunters. This Anime has an impressive combination of sound, visuals, and music. Each episode of Cowboy Bebop is almost like a short movie; only a few times does one episode require advanced knowledge of a previous one for it to make sense. Spike Spiegel is the enigmatic main character, who is complemented by the very cool-headed and likeable Captain of the Bebop; Jet Black. Later in the series various other character will join in, making up the Bebop&rsquo;s crew; Faye Valentine, Ed and a Genetically enhanced
                  dog, named Ein. 
This Anime has a good mix of action, from martial arts, awesome gunplay, to explosive space battles. There is quite a bit of light-hearted humor, but more sinister plots are a part of the whole. The musical scores enhance the overall feel of the show; the retro-jazz type music is unique to say the least. If you listen to only the music, you would never guess that it is in any way connected to an anime, Let alone one&rsquo;s soundtrack!
DARGON / Tera-Alpha's Notes:
This Anime searies is excelent! I have watched all of the episodes aired on Cartoon Network. The story line is unique in that it comes from a lot of differant directions, and is still exciting. The last episode does seem to be missing something, but there may be more to come; either as another season of the series or an OVA Movie (P.S.: A movie was reliesed some time after this review was originaly made. The movie was quite good, but basicaly like a longer eppisode that was stand alone from the plotline of the series.).

                Cowboy Bebop, this is one show it seems most have seen. It has been regarded as one of the best anime of all time, well, I wouldn't go that far but it was definitely good. I was turned off for a while with this show because I thought it was going to be some rip-off of star wars or some Sci-Fi I didn't want to see. But I thought the same thing (except the Star Wars part) about FMA brotherhood and I ate my words. So I figured I'd give this a shot. If you are like how I was and are avoiding Cowboy Bebop
                  lemme tell ya... it's only 26 episodes make the investment, you won't be disappointed.
Story-Ok here is the deal here, the cannon story is really good. The action is amazing I couldn't believe how awesome the action scenes were. The comedy was always a plus and the mystery and deep meaning got me and will get you hooked. But in the middle of the amazing story are a bunch of side adventures that you can call filler. Don't get me wrong the filler doesn't suck, but compared to the cannon and it kinda is pointless. There were some filler that was pretty amazing but others were a drag to get through and at the end of the filler episodes it doesn't leave anyone hanging which makes it tough to get through the filler and get back to the cannon in a short amount of time. Maybe you or others don't agree remember this is my opinion but some of the filler isn't worth it. 
Art- The art was an older style of art, this was a 90's anime so it is what one would expect. Of course not the best art I've seen but it works with the story. The fight scenes are really well animated and everything has their own distinct look. Props on the animators job well done.
Sound- The sound was amazing, everything fit just where it should have been, every soundtrack was perfect. When it was a sad moment the music made me feel that much more sad and the same is for happy and intense and all other possible emotions. The opening was amazing, such a catchy beat. I watched this in Dub because of the love for this show in Dub so I took popular opinion and watched this Dubbed and the voices were done so well. Even the extras were really well done when in some anime the extras have really bad voice acting skills. If I were to give the sound one piece of criticism it would be i didn't like the ending. There aren't many endings I like anyway for some reason but it is no reason to drop a level.  
Characters- It's characters like those of Cowboy Bebop that makes one cherish anime. The characters aren't even developed in the beginning (for mystery of course) and little by little you learn more and more. If that bugs you trust me the show  makes up for it with how bad ass everyone is. The villain although has kind of a stupid name, is so epic along with Spike and the crew that you wish you knew these guys in real life. 
Overall besides lack luster episodes the show was a truly great. You get hooked from the start with awesome action sequences, you meet knew people good and bad that make the show so damn good, and the Dub and sound is incredible. I can understand why people regard this as one of the best shows of all time. Personally it does not crack my top 5 but it would absolutely get my #7 spot behind Rurouni Kenshin. It was truly a show I could watch again, and oh by the way, the movie is probably the best anime movie  I have seen to date, yeah, it was that good. But Cowboy Bebop is a show worth watching and I promise you will like it,

                ** Minor spoilers alert **
Story (2/10) | This was the thing that, other than friends recommending me to watch this, made me start watching Cowboy Bebop: bounty hunting in space. I really love the idea, it is different and really creative, but unluckily it was poorly executed.
The first episode is really good. It starts off great and there's lots of action. Then I moved on to the second episode and again, I was impressed. Then I moved to the third one and I started getting bored. Why? Because I had just seen the same thing three episodes in a row, just with different animation. We
                  don't get an introduction to the story, just 1 hour of Spike ""working"" (I put it in quotes since when he goes bounty hunting he fails miserably really often).
I'm not asking that at episode three I should know every single detail about the plot, but I want to at least know what the characters are trying to achieve, I want a reason to care about them. I'm no professional critic, but I'd say that this is really poor writing since, until episode 20, all we get from Cowboy Bebop, excluding a few decent/really good episodes, is filler.
As a result of all this filler, the story has a really slow pacing. We get a few details about the actual plot of the show about 5 episodes in and nothing else until the last episodes, which is a thing that is unjustifiable for a show that has a mean rating of 8.78 and holds the 26th place in the ""Top Anime"" section.
There are a few exceptions, though. Faye's backstory episodes were really good and they are my favorite ones (which is why I rated the story a 2/10 and not 1/10). The last episodes are well written, but unfortunately they feel quite rushed as 6 episodes are simply not enough to develop the entire story.
Characters (3/10) | The cast of this show revolves around four characters: Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed.
I'll start by saying that I think they have some chemistry, they make for a slightly above average cast when you put them together, but when you look at them individually they are plain, one dimensional characters.
I'll start by talking about Spike. I don't get why he receives this much love from fans of Cowboy Bebop. Is it because he smokes? Is it because he says ""cool"" (edgy would be more appropriate to be honest) stuff all the time? Is it because he has a cool design? Is it because he is considered the most ""philosophical"" character of the show? I don't know. A show is not philosophical because the main character says stuff with a relaxed but intimidating voice while smoking a cigarette. Just no. The only things that we know about him is that he was involved with the mafia, that he fell in love with his brother's girlfriend and that he's stupidly good at fighting, and it makes no sense. I'm okay if the main character is really strong, but not as strong as he is. Don’t get me wrong, there are shows that manage to create an awesome show even if the main character is overpowered, but what Cowboy Bebop wants you to do is empathize with the characters. Do you empathize with Spike? Are you some kind of god-like martial arts fighter? I’m pretty sure that the correct answer for both questions is “No”.
He can't be killed, just lightly injured, he can get out of dangerous situations with ease and a really laid back attitude, almost as if his life wasn't on the line.
Then comes Jet. He is the ""mommy"" of the group. When Spike makes a mess, he is always there to clean up after him and save his ass. He is an okay character. Even though he might seem really rude he's a gentle giant, and deep down he is really kind and cares for his friends. Plus his backstory episode was really detailed. Faye, on the other hand, is a bitch. Despite being my favorite character (mainly because of her backstory episodes which were just amazing), she is completely unnecessary. All she does is bounty hunting with Spike and Jet, then steal what they earned together and leave for a few days/weeks, then come back and repeat. She doesn't serve any real purpose development of the story. She doesn't have any particular abilities and could have been left out in my opinion. All Jet and Spike do with her, they could do without.
I particularly hated Ed. Not as much as Spike, but I still hated him a lot. Spike, Jet and Faye went to Earth and Ed happens to live there. After he met them, he just asked if he could join their group. First of all, he joins the cast in the middle of the show for absolutely no reason. Why is this? We don't know, I assume he just... liked them (?). Then they were like ""No, fuck you"", but he forced them to take him with them. What? No, that's just not how it works. This is just a forced way to introduce a new character. You may be thinking ""But at least he serves a purpose, right?"". Yes, he does. Too bad he is a deus ex machina. Bad situation is happening on the spaceship? Don't worry! Ed the Genius is going to do some computer stuff and everything will be okay!
Also, he screams way too much. Annoying, boring and poorly written character.
I'm not going to talk about Julie and Vicious. They get very little screen time and it'd be just a waste of time.
Ein is... cute, I guess?
Sound (10/10) | I can't judge the voice acting unfortunately, I haven't seen either the Japanese or the English dub.
Not everything was bad about the show, though. The soundtrack was absolutely amazing, and probably Yoko Kanno's best work. Jazz music with traces of blues, bop, swing, and other genres. This is really good stuff, absolutely nothing to say about the sound department. Just perfect. One of my favorite OSTs.
Art (9/10) | The art is old, but it's still solid even compared to today's standards. I really liked the retro-futuristic style that was adopted. Together with the dark color palette, it contributes to give the show this decadent look which fits really well with the sad vibe and the feeling of ""being lost"" the show gives off. Just like for the sound department, I have nothing to say, it's amazing.
Enjoyment (2/10) | What can I say? Apart from backstory episodes, and a couple ""normal"" episodes, I was bored all the time. I've never felt sleepy watching anime, but Cowboy Bebop managed to make me pass out. Unfortunately for this show, in my rating story and characters are worth way more than sound and art. The creative side of the show was amazing, the rest was a complete mess.
This show is probably the most disappointing anime I've ever watched.

                I'm not a big fan of episodic anime. I'm also not really a fan of the werstern genre. 
The thing about Bebop is that it is in fact a classic. I can see that. In the same way I am not a big fan of classical music but can recognize the brilliance of Motzart, I can see that Bebop has its merits. 
The story and the characters work very well together. It feels like an anime version of Firefly (which personally I'd also right at about a 7). 
The thing is that, it wasn't really thrilling to me. The lack of a real long term
                  plot didn't really invest me in the characters. The characters felt deep and well-developed, and each episode individually wasn't bad, but the thing about episodic anime to me is that they can't really reach a climax. Even though Bebop's end climax was solid, it is different than watching characters change and struggle on a journey to reach the approaching peak. Bebop was sort of everyday living in this new world, then story resolution at the end kind of. 
I enjoyed it. It was solid storytelling, good characters. But I just can't get behind the universal praise Bebop receives. It's good, but no masterpiece.",7,esaoud,

                The year is 2071. Humanity has long since expanded into space, with civilization taking hold in various ways on a large selection of the different rocky bodies throughout the solar system. Luckily, we were already in the middle of this process when a hyperspace gateway near the Earth exploded, leaving the planet in ruins and virtually uninhabitable. It’s been fifty years since then, but we can still feel the effect of the disaster. Our colonies range from big, busy cities to smaller, less affluent townships that you’d swear were taken right out of the old west. Interspace travel means nothing to most folk, who were
                  born and raised and eventually expired on the same planet, hell, maybe even in the same town. Sure, those who chose the life of a transportation or delivery pilot may see a couple of different planets, and those rich enough to travel may have seen a few different sunrises, but if you’ve been everywhere, seen every shade of civilization, felt the grass and dirt of multiple planets beneath your feet, then you’re either a criminal... Or a Bounty Hunter.
Yeah, it turns out that with so much ground to cover, the central government can’t be bothered to uphold the law in every society, nor to keep up with wanted criminals who could be hiding out on any number of worlds. Thus, we’ve seen the rise of the registered bounty hunters, people who’ve taken on the job of tracking down and apprehending those with a high enough price on their head and delivering them to the authorities. It’s a job that offers you freedom, excitement, and the right to be your own boss, provided you’re successful enough to keep food on the table. Basically, it’s a job that appeals to those who would otherwise probably be outlaws themselves, real rough-and-tumble characters who just don’t fit into normal society. This description couldn’t possibly fit anybody more than the crew of the Bebop, a moderately sized vessel owned by a retired detective, that houses an ex-gangster, a femme fatale with a gambling problem, a psychotic child prodigy, oh, and also a dog. They may sound like a crew of rejects and shady characters, but with these cowboys on your tail, you might not even live to see prison.
Cowboy Bebop was produced by Studio Sunrise, a company that’s been churning out anime since the seventies, and is still just as prolific today, with some of their more recent hits including Code Geass, Love Live, and the entire Gundam catalog. Bebop was one of their last projects in the nineties, but there are a few other notable benchmarks it holds. First of all, Bebop was the last project that several people working for the company would make before they parted ways, and formed their own studio, the incredibly popular and well-respected Studio Bones. I’m assuming this split was an amicable one, because they were able to collaborate with their former parent company to make the Cowboy Bebop movie only a few years later. So yeah, the legendary production company that began in the 2ooo’s and is able to brag about producing both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist, Soul Eater, Ouran High School host Club and Space Dandy, to name a few, and it’s greatest precursor was Bebop.
And the other benchmark? Cowboy Bebop was one of the final anime to be animated using hand-drawn cells rather than digital drawings. You would think this would be an indication of lacking visual quality, as the last efforts of one style before another takes over are usually somewhat pathetic... Just look at disco... But Cowboy Bebop is a glaring exception to that rule. Not only is it one of the best looking anime of the nineties, it holds up today as one of the best looking anime of all time. Yeah, when compared to offerings from today’s market, Bebop definitely has a very retro feel to it, but since the series was originally designed to be retro, that just makes the aesthetic all the more timeless. The animation is unbelievably fluid, with action scenes that never have to break frames to look impressive, and space battles epic enough to warrant a comparison to early Star Wars. Even when the action does slow down, and the camera does linger on a shot, the artwork is beautiful enough... And the cinematography is smart enough... That you’ll never complain about what you’re seeing.
The character designs are diverse, but human enough that everyone you meet... Aside from perhaps Ed and a certain balloon-like villain... Looks like someone that could easily be translated into real life, at least in terms of anatomy and facial structure. Their outfits are set to color palettes and styles that match their personalities while still remaining pleasing to the eye, and the backgrounds throughout are highly detailed. Episodes that take place in a western background are bright and welcoming, despite being broken down, dirty and weathered with time. Episodes with a more noir feel will take place in a tighter and darker environment, more shadowy and dangerous. Outer space is portrayed as expansive and empty, even when it’s filled with stars and debris. The use of color saturation and shading easily sells the tone and genre of any episode, and if you’re watching the newly released blu-ray version of the series, all of the show’s beauty is cranked up to eleven. And it’s not just the art style that enhances Bebop’s visual quality.
I feel like the best way to describe the music in this series would be to inform you that the musical composer of the series, Yoko Kanno, was also the inspiration for the personality and mannerisms of the character Ed, so try to imagine the kind of musical score that a film noir space western would have if it came from a wild, free-spirited genius with no respect for convention. Translation, it’s spectacular, possibly one of the best anime scores in the history of the medium. The score leans heavily towards jazz and the blues, and while the instruments that Kanno’s band The Seatbelts has available are diverse, there’s an intense focus on trombones and saxophones, which in my opinion aren’t used enough in anime. It fits perfectly in Cowboy Bebop, as the aesthetic demands a funky sounding soundtrack, but the stuff they didn’t do themselves... And thus the music that breaks from the series style... Are just as good. There’s a Steve Conte song called “Call me call me,” in one of the last episodes, that actually makes me cry, both in and out of context.
The most famous musical number from this series is probably Green Bird by Gabriela Robin, which is actually a false name for Yoko Kanno herself, which beautifully accompanies what little glimpses at Spike’s backstory we’re actually allowed to see. A certain western sounding tune named Go Go Cactus Man is also noteworthy for heralding the appearance of a literal cowboy, and amusingly enough, Spike himself reacts to this tune when it’s played. Outside of the score, the sound design is also smartly used, with smaller unreleased musical pieces hyping up the tension and suspense of episodes like Toys in the Attic, but all of that pales in comparison to the show’s opening and ending themes. Both are iconic in their own right, with Tank serving as the funky, undeniably catchy pump-up for some space-faring adventures, and the closing theme The Real Folk Blues serving as the power anthem that feels just right as the send-off to each episode, whether it was funny, serious or downright tragic.
The English dub, as I’ve said before, has become something of a measuring stick, to which all other anime dubs must compare themselves to. That’s not to say I think it’s the best dub of all time... There are still three that I think have surpassed it... But there are plenty of fans and critics who will make that claim, and it’s completely understandable why. The dub was directed by Mary Elizabeth Mcglynn, one of the most respected names in the dubbing industry, and for good reason. She also played several small roles in the cast, including the mysterious Julia and one of the more memorable villains, environmental extremist Twinkle Maria Murdock. Her adaptive script is accurate and on-point, despite slight changes to appeal to a western audiences, and I have to point this out, there are very rare occurrences where an actor will slip up and fail to match the character’s lip flaps. This barely ever happens, however, so it’s forgivable enough.
In terms of acting, all four of the main characters have become the most iconic roles of their respective actors. Steve Blum has been considered a legend in the industry thanks to his turn as Spike Spiegel, a laid back and lethargic louse who cares for nothing other than his next paycheck, except for those rare moments that he’s made to care, either due to a resurgence of his past life or due to a fleeting chance at bringing some genuine good into the world. Beau Billingslea is a highly successful man in both his personal and professional lives, and he’s also one of the only well-known black voice actors in the anime dubbing industry, thanks in no small part to his performance of Jet Black, a former detective and the cool, mature voice of reason of the Bebop crew. Wendee Lee is a bit of a hit-or-miss actor for me, as the quality of her work seems to fluctuate from project to project, but she’s at her absolute best as Faye Valentine, a character who can be confident and duplicitous one minute but then vulnerable and emotionally raw the next.
Then you have Melissa Fahn, who somehow managed to bring more insanity to the character of Ed than even the original seiyuu Aoi Tada. Her crazy ramblings also include random tangents in Japanese, which she fires off smoothly. Together, the four of them form a bizarre sort of chemistry that never quite feels like a proper family unit... They feel more like coworkers, tolerating each other and accepting each others’ eccentricities as they strive towards a common goal. That common goal, mind you, is the money to survive, something essential and vital, but also entirely impersonal. There’s no bonding between these characters, no intricate relationships, no changing each other’s paths and arcs... The characters let their guards down and show vulnerabilities, but almost never around each other, and the English cast is just as good at portraying this as the Japanese cast. Add to this the hilarious contributions by James Penrod as the raucous Cowboy Andy and Lia Sargent and Paul St. Pete as the Big Shot TV hosts Punch and Judy, I do highly recommend this dub over it’s original sub.
I’ve always said, when defining what is and isn’t anime, that there really isn’t any set of qualities that can be taken into account consistently. No matter what rule you try to follow, there will always be outrageous exceptions made. The only philosophy that really makes sense is “Anime is made in Japan.” But for the people who actually try to draw a dividing line between anime and cartoons, there are a few arguments I keep hearing about. The first is that there’s an anime style. Big heads, giant tumorous eyes, small noses, exaggerated expressions... And another popular one is that anime is non-episodic, and tells a continuous story through plot progression and cohesive arcs. People will use these arguments as an excuse to call shows like Avatar and RWBY anime, and if you bring up shows like Shin-chan and Panty and Stocking, they’ll argue that those aren’t real anime, and were designed to be more like cartoons.
But then you bring up Cowboy Bebop, a show that doesn’t waste it’s time with stereotypical anime expressions, doesn’t follow any alleged anime style, and for the most part, is episodic and full of filler. It’s heavily adult in it’s presentation, despite the fact that it doesn’t contain any gratuitous content... No giant boobs, no multi-episode fight scenes, no nudity or fanservice outside of a transexual dude and Faye occasionally sunbathing... No beach scenes, no hot springs episodes... Cowboy Bebop isn’t like any other anime, even the ones that have tried to copy it in the 20 years since it’s release. The idea of there being an anime style is quite frankly bullshit, as that’s a seriously reductive viewpoint on the medium, but aren’t the best anime the ones with engaging stories and involved plots? This isn’t even close to the case with Cowboy Bebop, a show that did horribly during it’s initial release in Japan, so why is it considered one of the best anime of all time? Why is it still a mainstay on American TV over a decade later?
Well, there’s actually some backstory on that. When Bebop was initially released, the studio that played it got skittish about how adult it’s content was, and wound up airing it out of order, with several episodes left out entirely. This didn’t exactly build confidence with the audience, who weren’t even allowed to see the two best episodes, Ballad of Fallen Angels and Sympathy for the Devil. Keep in mind, this occurred in a country where that piece of shit Shadow Star was able to air on a Children’s Network. It was later run in it’s entirety on a less popular network named WOWOW, but the trouble it’s first network gave it provided a special kind of challenge for the series when it came to picking up steam. Heh, kinda reminds me of another series I know that got a lot of shit from it’s network, and was aired out of nowhere and treated unfairly by people who didn’t know how to handle it... In fact, you know what? Back up a bit. This show has a lot more in common with Firefly than just it’s initial problems, and I think I can use the comparison to explain why both shows are so immensely popular despite having a short run and a disastrous debut.
There are plenty of similarities between Cowboy Bebop and Firefly, and considering the few things that the latter stole DIRECTLY from Outlaw Star, it wasn’t very likely a coincidence. Both shows feature an old, beaten down spaceship that acts as a surrogate home for a crew of misfits, surviving day to day on whatever jobs they can take in order to keep food on the table and fuel in the tank. The focus is on character more than plot, and most of the cast has extensive backstories that translate to other lives they’ve left behind, but are still haunted by. In both shows, Earth got used up, and humanity colonized the solar system, with no real aliens out there, and the territory is populated with an anachronistic array of settlements that the crew travels to and does business with. Firefly wound up being popular to this day for the same reason that Cowboy Bebop didn’t get popular until it reached the states... Because it’s a story that was designed to appeal to an American audience.
Japanese society has always been deeply rooted in tradition and conformity. It’s true that a lot of it’s art has made valiant efforts to challenge the norm, from Kill La Kill’s blatant attack on said values, and Ikuhara’s work taking every opportunity to question the patriarchy, but for an anime to be about individuals who don’t fit into society making a life for themselves without any attachments outside of their own personal interests, with no real beliefs or values outside of their need to survive, and for this to come out way back in 1997, I find it more surprising that the series EVENTUALLY became big over there. But more to the point, Cowboy Bebop was, perhaps inadvertently, designed to be successful in America, so by ripping it off, Firefly became so popular that over fifteen years later, it has it’s own line of Lootcrate merch. And yet, despite the many similarities, Cowboy Bebop is still superior to Firefly in every conceivable way, and it’s able to be so without having to try nearly as hard as Firefly did.
First off, as much as I love it, Firefly was never that great at drama. Yeah there was danger, and characters would die, but actual emotional conflict? It would pop up in small doses, but never in any engaging way. It also, like MANY series both here and in Japan, used dangling plot threads to keep you watching. There were mysteries to be solved, romantic interests to be resolved, conspiracies to unravel... When shows do this, it can be great, but it still feels like there’s a carrot dangling in front of your face, daring you to run towards it. It goes perhaps without saying that Cowboy Bebop had none of these issues. It never needs to try to grab your attention... You don’t need to worry about what’s going to happen later on in the story, because everything that’s happening is perfectly interesting on it’s own. You don’t just want to see the characters prevail, and overcome each obstacle, preserving the status quo, you want to see them overcome themselves and break the stasis they’ve surrounded themselves with in order to find whatever it is they’ve been missing.
Cowboy Bebop is about four outcasts with nowhere to go, nowhere to call home, and pasts that they can no longer return to. In a sense, they’ve given up anything they once held dear in order to just survive day to day, putting their loved ones, morals and dreams aside because even if there is something for them to go back to, which isn’t always the case, doing so would carry unimaginable consequences, so you wind up having no idea whether you want them to find closure or just move forward. Anybody who’s held a job in order to pay the bills can immediately relate to this, and yet the fact that the crew of the Bebop have taken on even more uncertainty and risk by working a job that lets them hold onto a little bit of freedom by being their own bosses still makes them so easy to idolize. You get episodes of backstory for the entire main cast save for Ed, and these episodes are by far the best of the bunch because of everything they teach us about their past lives and how they wound up in this life, and then you’ll get the one-off episodes that are somehow just as awesome on their own, with so many imaginative and complex ideas that fit perfectly into the Bebop universe. All of these episodes, in their own way, explore the dichotomy of life, death, and the purpose that each serves.
Cowboy Bebop was originally available from Bandai, both in individual cases and in a much more attractive Remix collection set, which was my copy of the series for years until Funimation bought the rights, and released it on Gorram Blu-Ray. I don’t care how much your physical copies of this series mean to you, you need to buy it on Blu-Ray. It’s a lot cheaper than the Amazon Exclusive version, although that one DOES come with a whole slew of bonus goodies. The movie, Knocking on Heaven’s door, is also available pretty cheap at most locations, and it’s also really great. The manga adaptations are also easily available stateside, although you’re best bet is to look online.
Cowboy Bebop is not just an example of how anime can break it’s own rules and still be great, nor is it just an example of how good an anime from the nineties could look. It is also, and perhaps most importantly, an example of how a character driven story doesn’t need to have a plot, especially if it’s written in such a way that the characters ARE the plot. They’re all so likeable and so interesting that there are literally no boring moments throughout the series, because everything that happens involves them or is related to them in some way. I’ve heard some people complain about the crew not landing very many bounties, but I honestly think that’s the whole point. The ship is symbolic of the status quo that so many other shows rely on. As long as they stay there, sheltered from their old lives, they can never succeed, nor can they fail. They can never really live, nor can they die. They can only tread water, surviving. That might sound comfortable for some, but for Spike Spiegel, and ultimately for the philosophy of the series, it’s better to die young than to survive without living. This work, which has become a genre unto itself, is known as Cowboy Bebop, and I give it a 10/10.",10,Fear_the_Reefer,

                For my anime reviews I am going to review the anime on the order of which you would experience while watching an episode of the anime that is being reviewed.
1.Art - The first thing that spoke to me from this anime was how good the animation was.  Of coarse it wasn't the best animation but it must have required a huge amount of effort to animate it as well as it was animated.  The series' art was hand-drawn, that means that the animation was and just for that fact you have to respect the artists for this anime and the best part is
                  that the art continues to get better throughout the anime.  The art was spectacular but it isn't quite good enough to get a ten so it will get a 9.
2.Sound - First I wanna start of by saying the intro is just plain awesome.  They didn't have to make a second intro and they knew well that the first one was to good to be out-shined.  The rest of the soundtrack never bothered me, oh wait YES IT DID.  If I ever hear another horribly composed saxophone solo I am going to shoot myself…. I’m not kidding!  Other than, that the jazz feel really set a smooth mood to the action scenes, I totally dug it.  I can’t give a 10 because of those horrid saxophone solos so i’ll give the sound an 8 but that’s still pretty good.
3.Character - I don’t think that I will find another series with more lovable characters than Cowboy Bebop.  The characters were very unique and the were all lovable, even some of the people who weren’t main characters were lovable.  There is not much else to say about these characters, they were all unique, lovable, and well-developed and I wish that was how all animus were.  Undisputed 10/10 for characters.
4.Story - The story….. well….. wow. It was a good story to say the least and 
there wasn’t one instance where I wasn’t enjoying it.  A lot of people thought the ending was amazing but I really failed to see how it was so cool.  It didn’t 
blow me away like it might have intended to but it was very satisfying as an ending and it did leave me with a good feeling.  The story was amazing but for a little disappointment with the ending i’ll give it a 9.
5.Enjoyement - Well… I enjoyed this show a lot and I can with no doubt call it a classic but I have seen shows that are just as good or even better than this anime.  That being said, this anime made me feel like a bounty hunter and that is what matter the most.  I enjoyed this anime fully and it gets a 10 for enjoyment.
This anime is an overall 9.
*I would recommend this anime to a person of any age.

                Cowboy Bebop is the like the Firefly of anime. 
Although an older animation it still is consistently counted as one of the best anime's of all time and rightly so. A great story with some amazing characters make this a highly enjoyable anime.
The story is fantastic with a combination of mystery and action, however the pacing is odd at times and it feels like you are just watching filler episodes which at times can make it boring, but the baseline story remains strong and finishes it off well. 
The art although old fits well with the world that it is set in, everything looks dirty
                  and authentic. Old animation tends to turn people away form Bebop but after the first few episodes you grow into it.
The sound and voice recoding is not up to standard however with poor sound effects and sometimes awkward voice acting can make you cringe. The music of Bebop is fantastic, a brilliant opening theme really sets the mood for the upcoming episode.
The characters are the heart and soul of Bebop and make the show what it is. All the characters feel unique and have there own detailed back stories which give them depth. You really start to love them and by the end you don't want to say goodbye.
Overall this is a thoroughly enjoyable anime and I would recommend it to any fans of Joss Whedon's Firefly. A must see for any anime lover old or new.

                Cowboy Bebop is really one of the few animes out there that no one should pass up the opportunity to watch. I really fell in love with it, and it's revered as one of the best animes of all time. If you enjoy sci-fi with a mixture of action and comedy, I highly recommend this series. It's truly a timeless classic!
What I really enjoyed about this anime is that it really makes you think long and hard about what's important in life. The theme of how one perceives the world around them is quite the backbone to the story's overall arc and purpose. The characters
                  often find themselves wanting purpose, to explore the unknown, and to capture moments through their daily adventures and ""bounties.""
There's all kinds of different perspectives the series incorporates, which allows the viewer to think of situation in a whole new light. It also develops many dramatic and lethargic scenes to promote realism—that every day or outcome is not always a happy-go-lucky one, and allows the viewer to appreciate the complexities of one's existence. Similarly, Cowboy Bebop also artistically involves ""dreams"", or mentally-intriguing qualities that often leave you guessing, or allowing the viewer to clarify in their own ways.
The series has very few, if any ""filler episodes"", and without a doubt has one of the best soundtracks out there. Complimenting the theme of the series, the soundtrack includes mostly bebop and blues with little elements of gothic and baroque, electric blues, synthesized music, and even some references to Arabic folk.
Overall, you should definitely watch this series if you're looking for an epic masterpiece. It's delightful space opera film noir appeal will both delight and intrigue you. It will forever be on the top of my list of animes, and with all of its qualities mentioned above along with futuristic settings, new perspectives on life, and humorous, lovable characters, it's hard not to like ""Cowboy Bebop.""

                If you analyze the series in a completely analytical way, you might find certain segments that might bother you from time to time (for instance, the main plot might seem to get lost here and there thus resulting in episodes that might seem as unnecessary fillers, the music through the anime is good, but I've seen anime with much better soundtracks etc.) which is why there are some people who legitimately pose the question ""what's the big fuss about this anime?"".
But here is the catch, like all things, this anime is more than just the sum of all its parts. In fact, as I watched
                  it I enjoyed it to a fair amount and would give it a 8 or 9/10. But then one afternoon I sat down and looked at the last few episodes and I was stunned. Somehow everything came together and the entire series got such amazing depth and meaning, as well as the characters in it.
It amazes me how their creators could pull such an extravagant array of topics and genres and glue them all together in an incredible fashion. Action, drama, sci-fi, comedy,thriller, adventure, detective story, gangster, horror... you got them all here, and brilliantly executed and connected.
The soundtrack is another thing that worths mentioning. It is absolutely superb. Jazz, Blues, Rock, Country, Electronic, Ballads... an all American array of music. As many, many other cultural reference to USA.
This surely is one of the best anime I've seen with one of the most memorable characters you can sympathize with on different levels and, in my eyes at least, has the BEST ending I have ever seen in my life. Perfect, perfect, perfect.",10,Bebop2071,

                Cowboy Bebop is a show that I can best describe as an anime that dares to mix genres. On the surface it looks like your typical Space Western, but once you delve into the real meat of the show you will find everything from romance, action, comedy, philosophical themes and spirituality. The fact that the show manages to round so many corners in its 26 episodes, while still stringing together a coherent story, supplemented by an amazing cast of colourful characters, with heroes, villains and everything in between, makes it one of the most enjoyable anime I have seen in my entire life.
Cowboy Bebop is
                  an episodic anime. Each new episodes deal with a new story, with the exception of the character driven episodes scattered in between, that sometimes span over several episodes. The actual plotline is solid and engaging, leaving you hungering for more answers every time you learn a little more about one of the characters. It is the life that these characters have lead up until the point where the viewer meets them, that really help flesh them out and stop them from becoming one-dimensional stereotypes.
The artstyle in Cowboy Bebop is detailed, creative and fitting. Mostly dull metal and earth tones are mixed with neon colours and really help drive home the feeling of both the loneliness and grandeur that can be experienced in a galactic spanning civilization. One episode you might find yourself in the dusty streets of a Martian colony, the next in a colourful floating casino located in orbit around a planet.
The soundtrack is one of the many high points of Cowboy Bebop. Everything from tribalistic drumbeats to snazzy jazz tunes and even modern electronic music are to be found within the series and all of them help set the mood perfectly. In an anime that is as broad as Cowboy Bebop, a good musical score is immensely helpful in setting each episode apart from another and Yoko Kanno has done a fantastic job.
Now I will touch upon the characters of Cowboy Bebop, who in my opinion are what ultimately manages to carry this show into near perfection. The calm and collected Spike Spiegel, the grumpy and life-hardened Jet Black, the seductive and devious Faye Valentine, along with resident nutball ""Ed"" and her hyper-intelligent laboratory dog ""Ein"" make up the main cast of the show. Every single one of these characters have a story to tell and they are all interesting, action-packed and in some cases, heart-breaking.
These characters come together as Bounty Hunters in an attempt to escape the ghosts of their past. Most importantly the show doesn't forget about this. These characters aren't your typical goodie two-shoed heroes. Ultimately they are in it for the money and while they do have a working moral compass, they aren't shy when it comes to getting their hands dirty.
Overall Cowboy Bebop provided some of the most entertaining episodes of a TV-series I have ever had the joy of experiencing. Some episodes more suspenseful and thrilling than others of course, but all of them can hold their own and is almost guaranteed to provide constant entertainment.
Unfortunately I cannot give this show a full score across the board. The show does deal with some clichés that at times are a little bit uniteresting, not to mention that with the episodic build-up, some of the less relevant episodes can end up feeling redundant at times. Still very much entertaining, but not really adding anything to the characters or the story and while they are very, very few, they are there.
That being said, Cowboy Bebop is rock-solid from start to finish and raises the bar in terms of soundtrack and characters, earning it a fantastic 10/10.",10,Wulff,

                It was hard to realize where to start... The characters, the music, the art, it was all so incredible... 
 But the most incredible was the soundtrack, no doubt i pick my cd once in a while to listen to it. Those ballads, those blues and the scenes from the anime come to my head. Even after 5 years i last watched it i can remember those epic  chasing scenes, the shots, the fights, the problems spike went through. He's an awesome protagonist. 
 The art is really well made and the animation is smooth you can see Spike really running and the scenario
                  is running in the opposite direction, everything can be ripped into pieces in seconds... and the storyline... oh my god the storyline is just so wonderfull it keeps me wondering why it had to end.
It's totally enjoyable. Each and every piece of it. Forever.
This is one of those anime that will never get too old, too boring, too childish. This is a masterpiece !",10,haunt,

                Cowboy Bebop was a watershed for me . I was 16 years old when I first watched it and I remember how it was a great feeling to watch your episodes and it was sad to watch the last two .
It is very hard to find animes with such great quality nowadays, whether in history or even in art . I watch animes like Shingeki no Kyojin in and I think, "" What kind of crap is this ? "" . Besides the terrible stories , animations are bad and lazy.
I had never seen an anime with so much adrenaline and with a dose of
                  perfectionism as big as this anime.
Influenced by an amount of things, like jazz movement in the early 40's (?), to noir cinema, Nouvelle Vague, philosophy and even religious themes and samurai laws, Cowboy Bebop's animations flow naturally . You do not feel like everything is mechanized or robotic , even when scenes are repeated numerous times to save the work of animators, wich is hard to see in an anime with so much to say and so little time to show.
And speaking of work, I had never seen a soundtrack as flawless as Cowboy Bebop. A jazz music with influences from rock, pop, classical music and even bossa nova or gypsy music.
The story is about a group of bounty hunters , as you may already know and is told in ""closed episodes"", which is not very attractive . It was not, it is not and it never will be.
However , the trump card of the story are it's characters. They are strong and I do not speak of their physical size, but their personalities. None of the characters in Cowboy Bebop are typical anime cliches (like Goku or Luff) , nor are predictable and lacking charisma ( like the characters in Shingeki no Kyojin ), they are striking, original and unpredictable. You never know if Spike will lift your opponent or take shoot him in the middle of his forehead .
It is no exaggeration to say that Cowboy Bebop is one of the most influential anime of all time, next to Akira, the films of Hayao Miyazaki and, why not , Akira Toriyama ?
Cowboy Bebop opened Western's eyes to action animes, aimed at an older audience, who were satisfied with comics like Sandman, Allan Moore's comics and among others, and influenced all sectors of our artistic side of the world, since cinema, to comics, music and even literature.
You can find influences from Cowboy Bebop in mainstream films such as Tarantino and Matrix, to underground artists like Dawn of Midi and even King Krule .
Sure Cowboy Bebop was also very influenced ( Lupin III and the movement of jazz are just some of the more obvious influences), but it was the mastery in uniting all these references (musical, artistic, visual, literary, phylosophical and religious) that make this anime the best anime of all times , in the humble opinion of this fan .",10,fiilisboa,

Note 2: This review may have small spoilers.
 Cowboy Bebop is a totally original anime, is not an adaptation of a manga, light novel or anything before, was written and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe and the director of the brilliant soundtrack was Kobayashi Katsuyoshi.
Story (8/10): Cowboy Bebop tells the story of four bounty hunters trying to make a living catching wanted criminals and handing them to the police. Cowboy Bebop works in a way different from others animes, no arcs or anything like that, each episode is a different story with different
                  characters being added. Each episode they try to catch a wanted criminal or has a backstory of the main characters, there are some exceptions where the episodes follow in sequence with the 1st part and the 2nd part, the story is simple, however interesting, you see several different cases each episode and also the backstory of the main characters, but for me is the weakest point of the anime, because I prefer the division by arcs.
Art / Animation (8/10): considering that this is an anime 1998, the animation is very good and fluid, the well-designed characters and each very different from the other, not only in the characters design, the clothes too, action scenes are impressive too, very well made, in melee combat and also when they use firearms, speaking of fire, also very well done and lively, vibrant and bold colors, the smoke is also amazing, the space ships and design are also very good, the animation is very good indeed, but also has its small technical problems like all animation, but does not hurt one bit the experience.
Soundtrack (10/10): undoubtedly the most positive point of Cowboy Bebop, the soundtrack is jazz, blues and other popular music of the 80's and 90's, blends perfectly with the anime, sometimes the soundtrack is a bit of the old west style for a change, which is also very well made, the action scenes and especially in drama scenes you are impressed with such art work. It is truly a masterpiece.
Characters (9/10): I liked all the main characters, they are 
interesting, each with its strong and aggressive personality, taking Ed, she is very cute, spike is undoubtedly the most interesting, he seems unconcerned, but is more troubled by his past of the group, he is very skilled in melee combat, besides being a great shooter and also a talent with ships, Faye Valentine is extremely greedy and ""selfish"" always does everything to get along, but Faye inside is a child who does not know his past or ""the place that she should return"", she is not good in melee combat, but is good with ships fihts, Faye never had a intense gun battle to I evaluate his ability, but the little I've seen, she's good. Ed is just Ed, she's a hacker child who lived in an ""orphanage"" before being recruited to the Bebop, Ed is the typical noisy children, and live always hungry, Jet is the oldest of the group, owner of Bebop, who has a history with the police, but due to some events decides to become a bounty hunter, Jet always tries to be show the tough guy, but he cares a lot about his partner Spike, who lives just chasing his past and Jet does not agree with this, prefer Spike go ahead, Jet never had a melee combat, much less in a shootout, the to count on one hand the times he took action without I doubt the 2nd character with less focus i the anime, behind Ed.
Overall (9/10): 
I strongly recommend Cowboy Bebop if you like an anime with lot of action, drama, and a perfect soundtrack, undoubtedly an anime epoch and one of the best I've ever seen.",9,Corvo_409,

                *SPOILERS AHEAD*
If there’s anything I was once certain of in life, it was that Cowboy Bebop was overrated garbage. No greater than a 4/10. An episodic failure of a show.
It all began when Watanabe stole my heart with Samurai Champloo. Naturally, I moved onto Bebop afterwards. And what I saw was what I perceived to be a lacklustre, slightly corny, slightly contrived noir tale of a man with a Messiah Complex, one who remains apathetic and unchanged until his demise, with a little bit of your usual ""finding family amongst strangers"" cheesiness. It didn’t break my heart, it didn’t move me. Julia, Vicious, the syndicate
                  — I didn’t care. The hit-or-miss filler episodes — I didn’t care.
What did manage to capture my attention, however, were the larger-than-life characters. I felt drawn to them and their allure. It was one factor that made me want to give Bebop another chance. The other factor was when I encountered someone on twitter who met Watanabe at a Q&A in Scotland in 2013. He'd confirmed to her that Spike and Faye had been in love (further evidenced by him stating that he “liked her quite a bit”). I was confused, as all I recalled about the show was some soft nihilistic fatalism and the Ghost of Julia, Spike’s star-crossed, long-lost lover that Faye, your hell-raising femme-fatale, could never hold a candle to. Mind you, what do we have, right as Faye returns? “She *was* a piece of me that I’d lost. She *is* the other half I’d always longed for. She’s back.” Dramatic music playing on, Jet and I stumped in confusion. Both eyes, past and present, working in tandem, further indicated by the foil and numerous parallels shown between Julia and Faye. Julia, who we know very little about beyond these parallels, aside from her not reciprocating Spike’s feelings and her being matronly and homely (which we later come to realize, with a loaded pistol and under dreary skies, is far from the truth, a contrast to Faye’s appearance vs. inner-workings).
It’s in these sequences and these spoken-riddles that this Goethe quote from the XX Session comes to mind: “Whether it’s a human work, or a natural work, what we have to pay special attention to is its original intent.” It’s in the way, using only his eyes, Spike conveys to Julia the deepest of revelations in their final meeting that tell an entire story (too little too late — i won’t outrun my fate — i can’t let my past harm anyone else).
It was due to this, that I quickly became floored at the characterizations within Bebop. Champloo had introduced a dynamic, amiable cast that one eventually felt bonded to, so I was no stranger to the feeling. Perhaps it’s Watanabe’s typical fashion of introducing us to characters who at times resemble annoying, imprudent, or even innocent children, only to juxtapose it with a cold-blooded killer laying dormant, tones seldom awkwardly clashing. Or the way he individualizes seemingly conventional characters, refusing to stick to politically correct characterizations. Female leads revealing their awkward, intrepid natures and intelligence when least expected; dangerous men displaying a strong moral aversion to corrupt authority despite having committed unspeakable and perhaps unforgivable crimes, thereby reminding us that every person is capable of redemption.
Perhaps it was in the contempt the show held for its characters, subjecting them to demoralizing situations and debasing them until we fell in love with them all the more. Or their organic sense of chemistry, one example being the often comedic nature of the dynamic between a headstrong, impetuous Spike and disgruntled Jet. Or perhaps it was brought on by the fleeting glimpses at haunting affairs of the past, offered in waves of sequences that formed an amorphous whole, leaving me to my own devices in understanding the characters. Subtextual moments and dialogue became colorful in-turn. I found scrupulous attention to detail, that which had the ability to flip the show on its head entirely.
With such masterful writing, it’s no surprise that the story itself — a tragedy of a doomed fate encountering love and companionship in its final moments — threatens to bring its viewer to complete despair. One attempt to help circumvent this is the hints of said demise sprinkled and woven into every single episode leading up to it, imploring for us to recognize the protracted dream where Spike cannot. It fails to do so. Rather, Spike realizes it before many of us are able to, possibly even very early on.
Another attempt at alleviating this despair comes in the form of the Laughing Bull, reminding us not to fear death as it “casts its eye upon us gently and guides us into infinity.”  Watanabe and Keiko Nobumoto know a thing or two about spiritual undercurrents that complete the essence of a story. This manifests as the most beautiful of attempts: a young man with no future and a distaste for women, children, and pets being given the opportunity to experience all three. A taste of the mundane life he deserved: family, reciprocated love, security. And surely enough to provide closure?
Spike’s fate was bleak, yes. Inevitable, too. Yet he dies grinning.
“Why did you love me?” Julia asks. Like it was the wrong thing to do. It certainly wasn’t inconsequential. Judging by the way Faye empties her glock in her final scene with Spike, saving the final bullet to herself, you can tell it comes with a great price. But it might have been worth it. Bebop, for me, was coming to this realization, amongst more deeply personal ones.
(And on a more personal note: no matter how much the past darkens the present or even shortens it, good things possibly still exist and will continue to happen. Kindred souls, people whose paths are destined to touch mine might await me, even if no family does. Love and eternity are inextricably bound, too, though it seems we’re undeserving.)
All-in-all…. from a 3/10 to an 8.5/10. Fell deeply in love with this show. The good is so good that even its flaws are endearing.",9,horrorcores,

                Cowboy bebop is one of the most exciting and fast paced anime of all time, from fun action scenes, expansive universe and to amazing characters with great personality's, this one anime for anyone new to anime and for  the common anime goer.  
              ",9,DunedainDovakiin,

                This anime is an icon and an inspiration.
The anime is revealed in episodes, with each episode having its own story with occasional flash backs (for character development) in between. It is simple and easy to understand. Each episode is so perfect that it is able to provide some brief history about the events that occurred as well as cover the current happenings. The episodes also have nice combination of some light heartened and emotional moods. The endings are quite satisfying (in general manner).
The art is bit dull but it fits in showcasing the anime as western style anime. Characters are well defined with each having
                  its own unique features which match their personality. The background details like vehicles, planets and space stations across the anime do not diminish in quality.
The animation is very fluid given it is a decade old and no digital tech was not used.
Voice acting is wonderfully performed as it properly matched with the personality of characters and the emotions they show. The music in the anime involves jazz, blues, classic rock which gives awesome emotional detail to given situations. The opening theme “TANK” is one of the main features of the anime. It gives an idea of what expect in the anime. And just listening it creates eagerness for the show.
Each character in this anime is at height of cool in their respective areas (personality wise) thus making them memorable. Spike is a bounty hunter, martial arts specialist and awesome pilot. Jet, earlier a cop and now head of the bebop crew, he is somewhat like guiding figure for others. Faye is an independent, stylish woman with a bad habit of gambling. Edward is a genius child from earth whose presence create situation light hearten. Their way of working out the circumstances together given their diverse backgrounds is most interesting to watch. Characters also have to face their past which shows how they react to situations which are sensitive to them. And they do it quite well.
Cowboy bebop is truly amazing amine with all the right mix of characters, story, and animation thus being among the best anime of all time. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime.",9,BBird,

                Cowboy Bebop is a legendary anime series made by the legendary studio Sunrise. Cowboy Bebop is often hailed as a masterpiece by the vast majority of people, and I’m no exception. Yeah, I’d usually save the personal side for the end of the “review” but I’m not gonna sugarcoat it, I believe Cowboy Bebop to be a masterpiece. It’s one of the few times I watch something & I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it. So instead of writing a review in the way I usually would, I’m going to do something a little different. I’m instead going to give my top 5
                  reasons as to what makes Cowboy Bebop just work. Without further ado, lets jam.
Reason number 1 Bebop works, the way in which it does the episodic format.
Episodic formats are incredibly difficult to get right. The episodic format often suffers from lacking character development, & a formulaic, repetitive nature. Cowboy Bebop has neither of these. Cowboy Bebop’s episodes are largely different from each other. Even though they use the structure of the bebop crew going after a bounty, the setting, scenarios, sequences, etc. Are all different from one another. Going back to the line of “lacking character development”. This is something a lot of episodic shows have, which isn’t always a bad thing provided the series in question gives us characters with enough depth & interesting attributes attached to them, but it can be underwhelming to not see somebody grow. Cowboy Bebop hits the perfect sweet spot of giving us characters with interesting attributes, yet still developing them at the same time. These characters subtly grow as the series goes along, & it’s heavily appreciated.
Reason number 2 Bebop works, Art, Animation, & Attention to detail. So I’m cheating a little bit & doing a 3-for-1 here, but they all tie into one another. Cowboy Bebop has phenomenal artwork that looks like it hasn’t aged a day (aside from the CGI). There’s incredible attention to even the tiniest of details that most viewers wouldn’t even notice that’s how much the team cared about this anime. The animation is also incredibly stellar, there’s a few times where they cheap out a little bit, but 99% of the time Bebop is consistently well animated, even the shots with little movement in them have that attention to the tiniest details that I mentioned earlier. The character art is also spectacular, the choice of colors used for the crew of the Bebop allow them to stand-out & look good in just about any setting. 
Reason number 3 Bebop works, the cast of characters, main & side. I’m not going to mention every single character in this segment of the review, but I’ll say it right now, Bebop has a phenomenal cast of side characters. Each & every one of them has something to offer, are interesting characters in their own right, have motivations for what they’re doing & why they’re doing it, if I could sum up the side characters of this show in one word, “Memorable” would be my word of choice.
But if the main characters aren’t very interesting, then it means nothing. Thankfully, Bebop has a cast of individual & interesting characters. Much like the side characters, Spike, Jet, Faye, & Ed are all given their own backstories, character traits, & personality. Spike is the laid-back one who would rather sit back on the Bebop until something exciting happens. Jet is somewhat of a father figure amongst the crew, keeping everybody in check. Faye is the feminine badass who’s always on the look-out for any money-making opportunity that may come her way. Ed is the comic-relief of the group who’s a computer hacker & teenage genius. What makes these characters just work are not only the dynamics between all of them that the show creates, but the fact that everybody has something to contribute to the show.
Reason number 4 Bebop works, the audio department. This is perhaps one of the most important parts to what makes Bebop work, not just its soundtrack, but the voice acting on both sides. 
I’ll start out with the music, Bebop makes use of Jazz, Blues, & Bluegrass for its OST. The music itself is not just great on its own, but the show is made around the music. Before anything else, the music for Bebop was created, for god sake “Bebop” which is a form of Jazz is in the title of the anime’s name, music was very important to the series. Yoko Kanno is a name I hope all of you are familiar with, because she’s the one you have to thank for creating this incredibly dynamic soundtrack.
Now onto the voice acting, the voice acting on both sides are phenomenal. The thing with Bebop, it has a much more realistic & grounded nature to its overall tone than most other anime do, despite the fact that Bebop takes place in the future & the characters live in space. So the style of voice acting they would want for this series would be something that sounds natural, almost as if the voice actors were the characters themselves, & Bebop absolutely nailed it. The character dialogue sounds incredibly natural, & you can just tell that the actors were getting into their roles. There’s incredible nuance on both sides. Again, as if the characters themselves are in the studio recording their own lines
Reason number 5 Bebop works, the way it portrays the reality of its world & handles tone. I’d have to say, my absolute favorite thing about Cowboy Bebop above all else is how it portrays the realities of its world. The characters don’t always win, sometimes they win big, but a lot of the times they don’t, sometimes they half win, half lose. Above all else though, the characters just move on from it, they never dwell on their misfortunes, & neither does the show itself. Life goes on in the Bebop world, & so do the characters along with it, I can’t state enough how much I love this aspect of Bebop. 
Another appreciative part of Bebop is how it balances both darkness, & light-heartedness. There are more comedic scenes, & more dark, serious, & somber scenes where character development & world building is usually going on. What makes this work though, is that Bebop not only knows when to use these, but it knows not to go overboard with them. Cowboy Bebop never becomes so laughably dark that you can’t take it seriously, nor does its comedy become overbearing enough to the point where it becomes annoying. So again, just more examples of how balanced Bebop is as a show.
Final Thoughts/Overall
I probably haven’t said enough great things in this review, but if I said every single little thing about what makes this anime work so well, we’d be here all day, & I don’t want to make you guys read a college essay about why some guy on the internet loves Cowboy Bebop so much. I said it at the beginning of the review, but I’ll say it again. Cowboy Bebop is one of the few times I watch a show, & I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it, I don’t even think I could nit-pick something about this series that’s how quality Bebop is. With everything said, Cowboy Bebop is going to receive a deserving 10/10, it’s not my favorite anime, but I’ll be damned if it’s not the most quality anime I’ve ever seen.",10,unimportantuser,

                Cowboy Bebop... I feel like everything that can be said about this show has been said. It is widely regarded as one of the best anime to have ever been released, with fantastic and memorable characters, great animation, a fantastic soundtrack and one of the best English dubs ever. As this is one of my favourite shows this will be more of a gush than a review as there are very few flaws in this show, but i just really wanted to talk about Bebop. So lets get down to it.
Story: 10/10. Cowboy Bebop follows the adventures of a ragtag group of bounty hunters (known
                  as Cowboys) who travel on a space ship called the Bebop. The effortlessly cool Spike Spiegel, the grizzled ex detective Jet Black, the seductive femme fatale Faye Valentine, the incredibly smart but strange Ed and Ein a super smart welsh corgi. Bebop follows an episodic format with pretty much each episode having little or no collection to episodes previous save for a few, now something like this doesn't always work for shows Bebop is one of the best examples of how to do it right, every episode has an interesting story to follow and most of them reveal little or massive details of our lead casts backstories, and even if they don't the stories told themselves are interesting enough to keep your attention. They can also allow for the show to play with the tone of each episode and still have it work to the shows advantage with some being played more for comedy, and others having more drama. Some of my favourite episodes include the episodes Cowboy Funk, in my opinion one of the funniest episodes in the series, Pierrot Le Fou which has one of the most chilling endings to an anime episode I've ever seen and Ballad of Fallen Angels the fifth episode which i suggest is the episode you need to watch up to before deciding to drop it or not as it tells a fantastic story, has one of the best shootout scenes ever and a beautiful scene involving a church window which is all i'm gonna say. To cap it all off the final episode of Bebop is incredible leading to an amazing final scene and an iconic ending. Simply put though Bebop doesn't have much of an overarching story the individual stories it tells are pretty much all fantastic, and when it's overarching story kicks in it only gets better.
Art: 10/10. At the time of writing this Cowboy Bebop is 20 years old (originally airing in April 1998) and even 20 years on from it's initial airing the show still looks amazing. Bebop is a sci fi and it takes a similar approach to its setting that the original Star Wars movies took. The world looks and feels lived in and the art and animation really help convey that. For example the Bebop is a run down second hand ship that looks like something these type of people would live in, it's very similar to Start Wars Millennium Falcon. The environments also have this aesthetic, they look run down and lived in, simply put the world Bebop presents feels real. But where Bebop shines here is in its animation which is basically perfect, everything moves naturally and very smooth. An example of this comes from Spike who's fighting style is inspired by Bruce Lee's Jeet Kun Do and this really shines through in the animation as shown in the first episode during his fight with Azimov, it's also important to remember that all of this was hand drawn as opposed to the digital animation used today which makes how smooth everything moves even more impressive.
Sound: 10/10. Right so lets just jump in here, Bebop's soundtrack is one of the best ever composed for an anime. Yoko Kanno is one of my favourite anime composers primarily due to her range as a composer, with shows like this, Stand Alone Complex and Zankyou no Terror really showing off the different types of sounds she can produce. But Bebop is easily her best work, with a super catchy smooth jazz soundtrack as well as the amazing Rain played during episode 5. Let's not forget Bebops iconic OP Tank that never fails to get you excited to watch the series, also you'll likely be humming it for weeks to come once you've heard it. Aside from the OST the actual sound effects are also great with the ships sounding fantastic, fight scenes sounding very impactful either in fist fights or shootouts and the general foley being great. Also as stated before Bebop has one of the best English dubs to have ever been produced with all the VAs fitting their characters perfectly and providing some A+ acting. Full disclosure I have never actually watched this show in Japanese so I can't comment on the subbed but I am sure it's equally as good.
Characters: 10/10. Bebop's strength lies in it's characters, the crew of the Bebop are diverse and interesting with pretty much everyone being fleshed out incredibly. My favourite thing abut the show is that the crew for the most part can't really stand each other, but due to their circumstances (that being they can never really get money due to screwing up bounties or Faye gambling it all away) they are forced to put up with each other in order to get by. While he characters all start out entertaining once you begin to delve into their pasts you begin to see how damaged they all are (Spike and Faye in particular have amazing backstories) taking them from entertaining tropes to fleshed out and memorable characters who you'll remember for years to come. Aside from our crew the series has many side characters who mostly make one off appearances, though a few appear in multiple episodes. These characters work for the episodes they are involved in but some of them are just as memorable as our lead cast. For those curious the series does have an antagonist, Vicious who has ties to Spike which i won't say here. But he is a fantastic foe portrayed as cold and merciless with his story throughout the series being very well done. If i had one complaint with the show here it primarily comes from the character of Ed, who while very entertaining and likeable but i feel isn't as fleshed out as the others on the Bebop, she does get some backstory towards the end of the show but i would've liked a bit more. But that's just a minor complaint in the end and doesn't effect my overall thoughts n the show.
Enjoyment: 10/10. Bebop is an engaging watch, it hooks you with its amazing characters and setting and takes you along for the ride and by the end of its 26 episodes you'll have been left fully satisfied. Bebop is one of those few shows that if it had like 500 episodes i could watch every single one of them as the characters are just so damn likeable. But I feel it ended when it should've and it just makes the show even better.
Overall: 10/10. In the end I probably didn't need to write this review, but I just wanted to gush about one of my favourite shows ever made. Put simply if you've never seen Bebop. Watch it, if your a fan of sci fi, great action, characters and just anime in general. Bebop is something you owe it to yourself to watch it's just that good.",10,Silver_Soul_Gin,

                Cowboy Bebop is an unusual series. Many of the episodes were meaningless, with only senseless action in them, which I found boring. However there were episodes that were full of thrill and developed the characters greatly. 
For starters, at about episode 12 is that the series turns EXTREMELY INTERESTING. In each episode after that one the series becomes more enjoyable. The character development is GREATLY done. How each character learns more about each others' past and this makes them closer to each other; THAT is what I mostly liked about the series. 
However, I found that the series had many episodes that were literally pointless;
                  just meaningless ""bounty hunting"" that involved looking up information of someone and than going out and capturing them-- which they usually failed. These episodes had no plot and no character development what so ever. episodes some of the episodes from 1 through 11 are just that-- pointless bounty hunting-- except the episodes where they meet Vicious, Faye and Ed. 
The characters were very enjoyable, but they left somethings out that could have been made clearer. I, personally, thought that the ending could have been better. But overall, this was an enjoyable anime, EXCEPT for the ending, did not like it.....",8,paranomia19,

                A good anime has three things: well choreographed bloody fights, laugh-your-ass-off comedy, and heart-wrenching, tear-jearking emotion. Cowboy Bebop has all of them in godlike proportions.
It has a bit of a slow start; not all of the main characters are introduced in the first episode. Also, all episodes bar about 9 are fillers, or not essential to the overall story. However, this is where all the comedy comes from, and the fillers make for a nice break in-between the gripping storyline.
The characters are fairly basic, but all have their own intricate past which is revealed at various points throughout the anime. This makes you feel like,
                  once you start watching you can't stop, you need to know what happens next.
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, almost solely for the three reasons mentioned above. Watch it. You won't regret it. And, being only 26 episodes long, it won't take you ages and ages to get finished.",10,hentainigami,

                The story of cowboy bebop is well..... episodic.There are three kinds of episodes.The episode with Spike,Jet and Faye hunting for bounty heads or try to find food .The episodes with character development and backstorys and the ones with the actual story with Vicious,Juia and Spike.The art was preety good  most characters looked pretty good and for its time it was really good.Now the winning point of cowboy bebop(too me at least)the characters, all of the characters were important and not annoying the villain Vicious was by far my favourite a total badass and one of the best villains9in my opinion).I really enjoyed the series
                  because of the awesome setting and great episodes by far my favourite was the one with the fat crazy murderer",10,SnakeMan14,

                Honestly anime is very hit and miss with me, either I love it to death or I hate it. This is an anime I love. I think it's a wonderful anime and, all in all I actually enjoyed all the episodes, which almost never happens with me and anime. I binge watched this in 2 days and now understand why this is largely regarded as a classic.
Story: 10/10
While the story is of an episodic nature,  every bits helps develop the characters and the universe, and such it doesn't feel filler at all. It's a great mix between sci fi and space opera, and there's
                  effort done to give so credibility to the universe it's set in. Basically, it's set around a crew of bounty hunters in the years 2071, and their travels around the solar system looking for bounties. The setting is quite simple, but it's well executed, and every episodes adds a bit more to the characters stories, so that we learn every time a bit more of their past, and of their tragedies.
Which brings me to:
Characters: 10/10
The story is great in it's own way, but if it works so well it's because it's carried by such a great set of characters. From Ed the tomboyish hacker to Ein the Welsh corgi, every characters add something to the show, making it so much more interesting to watch? They are all well thought out and developed more and more as the series continue, making us learn of their pasts by small bits. The voice acting is great too and brings a lot to the characters. I've only watched the sub, but i've heard the dubs were great so I think I'm going to watch that next, to compare the two. 
Sound: 10/10
The soundtrack of this show is just amazing. from the OP,  Tanks!, that's energetic af and sets the tone for whats to come, and the ending song, the Real Folks Blues, it really sets up a great atmosphere. The background music itself is amazing too, and helps move the story along. It's not a forgettable soundtrack, that's for sure, and every bit of it, from the harmonica tune to the sax solo  works very well with it all. The ending song  changes twice, only for one episode each, but it works really well and shows significant twist in the plot. Especially after the last episode. The ending song there is just perfect to stare at  your screen...
Art: 10/10 
For a show made in 1998 the art and animation aged remarkably well. It doesn't look too dated and the colour scheme helps to set up this western-like vision of the future. The animation is smooth and fluid, and the fight scenes, in space or otherwise, are really a sight to behold. The characters designs are also memorable, and the background looks awesome. I found some of the skies particularly beautiful.
Enjoyement: 10/10
I think it's a trully enjoyable show. It can be comedic, serious, sometime even sentimental 
( cause let's be real at the end you do care about what happens to the characters) but there's not one episode I didn't enjoy. They might be weird, funny or serious, I think they all have their appeal and such the show has a great binge watch capacity.
Overall: 10/10
I honestly recommend this to everyone looking to start  a new show. It's just great, and for me at least truly deserves to be put among the masterpieces of anime. Of all the anime I saw so far I won't hesitate to say that this was by far the best yet.",10,Liria12,

                Anime like DBZ, Cowboy Bebop, and Naruto do not really require anymore reviewing.  They are so well-known and praised that you are either a fan or you're not.  There's not much to add to the topic but I was bored.
Maybe because I was fairly young and not yet jaded by anime when I saw Cowboy Bebop, but I still consider this anime my favorite and one of the best I've ever seen.  It has everything; great art and animation, music and sound, characters, action, creative design, style, and story.  I'm also positively biased towards anime with a definitive beginning in end,
                  usually lasting only one or two seasons.  I have trouble getting into endless series like Naruto and Dragonball even when I was younger.
I especially like the pop culture references.  Examples are the Bruce Lee inspired fighting, John Woo gun play, multiple episodes that feature the atmosphere of old Westerns, and an episode that even feels like my one of favorite sci-fi movies, the original ""Alien.""
I mentioned characters, which is one of the best elements of Cowboy Bebop.  Strong female characters are always a plus and the iconic Faye Valentine is certainly up there with the best.  She's both sexy and entertaining but the spotlight belongs to Spike Spiegel.  He is a refreshing change from the usual cliches of anime protagonists.  He has since been imitated with varying degrees of success, but at the time, there were few characters written and created as well as Spike.
I could go on forever talking about Cowboy Bebop.  Like I said, with an anime that is on so many ""top"" lists there isn't much point.  I would recommend this to any one looking for a quality anime.",10,lazy-guy-1911,

                A fantastic show that defines the space western genre but is let down by mediocre character development and a rushed ending pretending to be deep when in reality, is just premature.  Watch episodes 1 through 23 while skipping Jupiter Jazz part 1 and 2, and then watch the movie as a finale, you'll finish the show feeling much more fulfilled instead of let down. The characters throughout the show fail to arc meaningfully or form any bonds otherwise. The entire ending of the show could've been drastically improved is the characters could follow a path of reason. Its hard to describe the short comings
                  of the show without spoiling its better parts. It really is a great work of early anime but I wholeheartedly recommend avoiding Spike's plot line.",6,Cinnjin,

                I have a special place in my heart for this one, Trigun, and Inuyasha because they were all my first anime and that's just how it is. So sorry if this review comes off as biased.
Characters: My favorite character is Spike not just because he is the main character but because he is so quiet and stoic. I always adore stoic or moody characters (gun x sword -.-) I love his fighting style and his cheesy one liners.
Faye is another awesome character. She is basically potryaed in a dull way but I love her outfit so much and the hair.
Edward is a doll and she
                  is another favorite of mine.
Jet Black is the character that adds in humor and insight and he helps the plot to move because we all know Spike would just lay there forever and ever without someone to push him.
The animation: Was very good to me, I love the drawing style.
The plot: Always changed and I like that, that's what keeps the show interesting.
I actually love and perfer the dubbed version. The voice acting was spot on. I really enjoyed this series.",10,Sasunaru4life,

                After all these years, I've finally watched Cowboy Bebop. And I have a great time.
Cowboy Bebop is a classic into the anime world of 26 episodes, Aired in 1996 by the studio Sunrise.
He was aired in 1996. 1996. Yes it's the third time I write it, but it was an important detail, because I was so amazed by the animation !
So the first point: the draws and the animation. It's one of these rare pearl in this field.
It's dynamic, clean, and precise. And God knows we needed this to follow these bounty hunters ! 
I though have already saw all about 90's japanimation, but this
                  anime surprised me, really a good job.
There is CGI sometimes, but not a nuisance, pretty well-mastered.
The second striking point for me are the OST. Or do I call them, Insert Song? The large majority of the OST are  already know famous jazz song, it sets a unique atmosphere, very interesting.
It's by the way the anime slogan ""the work which becomes a new genre itself will be called Cowboy Bebop"" and after finished watch the anime, I think they are true.
Oh and the opening James Bond's style is awesome!
Characters are endearing. Excepted Ed who, for me, is here for scenaristic readiness.
They all have 2 or 3 episodes about their past and other, and it's largely enough.
When I heard about this anime, I though that it was very serious, dark, and take itselfs too seriously. But hey, humour was here too! And is probably the most revelant side of this anime.
3-4 Boundy Hunters so poor that they can't eat and have to hunt all the time.
Plus, interactions between characters are hilarous!
So, why only 9 ?
The problem, for me, comes from the genre itselfes. 
The serie are composed of stand alone episodes. And I didn't really like that. It was cool the first part of the serie, but after, you're awaiting for a show which tell something ! And all elements was here: Endearing characters with tragic past, OST, atmosphere.
But no, there is only a few episodes about their past dispersed through all the serie. I think it's too bad.
But to conclude, this serie is fun, with an unique atmosphere, excellent OST, endearing characters and perfect 90's animation. A Masterpiece. Hurry on it !",9,Sceptique,

                Cowboy Bebop - before you decide to watch this anime get ready to go on a serious feels trip. It may seem harmless, but it's a lot more than just a comedy - based anime. This genius work of art, coming from Shinichirō Watanabe (you may know him from directing Samurai Champloo, Zankyou no Terror or Sakamichi no Apollon, he produced all of those aswell), will take you to the realms like you've never experienced before.
Eventho the anime started airing throughout 1998, and finished in about April 1999, it had pretty decent animation I've to say. But I'd still rate it a 6, just because
                  most of the scenes are portrayed as moving pictures, and don't any actual animation in them. But I guess that's reasonable because it was 1998 and all that shit.
Neverthless, this anime posses one thing that I rarely see in the anime made throughtout this millenium - the actual goddamn story. The story itself isn't a fascinating one I'd say, but I've enjoyed watching the fillers that cover the background story of every single character itself. The reasons why they were scarred, the reasons why they did the stuff they did, and so on. I found it so much more amusing watching the anime that was made at the end of the previous millenium that these they make nowadays tho. The animation may be poor, but you can see the actual story somewhere.
So, without further a do, as you can read in the synopsis, the whole story revolves around Spike and Jet, two bounty hunters who chase intergalactic criminals and do badass stuff all the way down to it. The anime was quite well paced I'd say, not too fast, and not too slow I guess. And yeah, the ending was perfect I'd say, just to my liking. Of course I won't spoil the ending, just saying it tho.
Oh, and so my favourite part - the OST's of this anime are really, really amazing. That opening song was easily the best one I've ever heard. Every single time I watched the opening, which I really rarely do, I mostly skip them all. The music matches the scenes so well, you just can't hate it. I mean, who doesn't love a chilly OST or an opening song? Well, that's about it, the only real thing I can complain about here is the animation, so I rated it a 6, but the whole anime overall - I rate it a pure 10.",10,thegreatbakson,

                The plot is great but there is too much filler that isn't related to the story. The music is awesome, having both blues and jazz.  Of course the characters are great, Spike is my favorite character but he gets too little screen times, more focuses on him would make the show a whole lot better
The animation is actually pretty impressive for it's time . The fight scene was short but smooth, short and sweet .  The music, the character and the animation combine together makes Cowboy Bebop one of the most stylish anime I have ever seen.",8,JackFisher,

                Cowboy Bebop is the most consistently outstanding anime I’ve ever seen. From the general theme to the characters, the episodic series will stay within its boundaries while also keeping you guessing. The music and art create one of the most iconic aesthetics in the animation industry, and after 20 years it hasn’t aged a day. By speaking my mind I’m basically repeating the praise of countless other critics, so let me analyze some of the more understated aspects of Cowboy Bebop.
For one thing, the subtle sexual tension between Faye and Ed is so wholesome and endearing. The two girls have differences in maturity and size,
                  but they share similar motivations. They both joined the Bebop crew for a fresh start, and they stayed for the sense of belonging. They found solace with each other as some sort of family. From the moment of their first meeting, Faye and Ed couldn’t seem to keep their eyes off each other. It’s hard to notice at first, but as time passes and they learn more about each other’s pasts, they grow closer and develop a more intimate relationship. Although Spike and Jet take the spotlight for most of the show, I think that the Faye x Ed arc is the best in the series. Nothing graphic regarding the two girls is ever shown on screen unfortunately, but I am almost certain that the director has a cut that had to be taken off for television. Why else would the budding romance be so obvious? There is nothing between Spike and Jet or any other combination of protagonists. Upon rewatching, I figured out that Spike might have gone for Faye if she hadn’t already devoted herself to Ed. This detail adds even more depth to the amazing ending. I can see myself revisiting Cowboy Bebop in the future and uncovering additional finespun undertones. 
This anime was the first 10/10 I have ever given. It pretty much is the highest standard for me. See, kids? You don’t have to watch Citrus for some action. Just join a group of bounty hunters and their corgi on a space adventure.",10,PicklePride,
1,"
                This series is quite old, and yet no so much; it would seem vintage but it is only an apperance.
The show itself you might say is progressing quite slowly and yet it would seem to be going in its own pace, not slow yet not brief and taken straight to the point. the combination of the music genre of blues and jass along the show, the lack of many flashy events and effects.. it has only made me to think that all of that was meant to make this a monument the these music genre, slow and quiet yet beautiful.
This was defenitely one of the
                  best animes i have ever watched, not the first but absolutely it owns its spot in one of the highest ranking along all of my exprience as an otaku.",9,kiki30501,

                Cowboy Beboop (ha) is an episodic anime with a dog. That is not a bad thing but that is essentially what is. The story is set in the future where the earth was partially destroyed and most humans live in space. It follows Spike and Jet, two cowboys (space bounty hunters) and their adventures in space.
This is an easy set-up for an episodic show to use because much like space the possibilities of an episodic show are infinite. It adds a few more mainstay characters that we learn about and that are interesting (including a dog!). The crew of the Bebop (Jet and Spike's ship)
                  are nicely miss-matched group, even Spike and Jet, but it's this clash of personalities and characters make them all the more enjoyable as a group and as individuals.
In saying this the voice actors do a good portrail of their individual character (I watched the dub). They're many moments in the show that gave you the 'feels' as it were, so one couldn't really argue that the VA's weren't in it, at least as my memory of the show serves. Furthermore the score was well done and makes every scene better than they usually are and is one that'll definitely stick if your a jazz or slow jam person. In addition the OP is one I still enjoy to this day and really works well both as an OP and a stand alone song, the ED thought not as good makes each episode feel complete.
The art style looks worn, though that is only due to Bebop's age and either be a plus or a minus depending on the taste of the person. Everything in the world of cowboy bebop feels and looks real to a degree and the movements are descent. The stiller moments seem to shine for me more than the more action packed scenes but that's not to say they weren't good I just like the quieter moments in cowboy bebop more.
Lastly I'd like to say that I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop as both an idea and a show. I don't enjoy a lot of episodic shows because they get repetitive (Simpsons, Spongebob, Fairly Odd Parents) but Cowboy Bebop shuffles the focus every episode to offer a little something  for everyone. No episodes felt the same or dealt with the same character or plot, which is to be expected of an episodic show and as such a lot of the plot comes at the end.
In conclusion if your looking for old, fun, gritty, and episodic anime that feels different every episode then Cowboy bebop is the show your looking for.",7,Tshepilepci,

                I really wish I seen this series years ago. Ok! so this is my first review for MAL but this amazing anime is worthy of my written opinion. I love how Bebop through each episode feels like a different genre each time, it a journey a adventure that honestly needs no big plot. Just a story of four individuals who so happenly come together
they each have some kind of past. The series has fantastic action, beautiful and a legendary ost from the lovely Miss Yoko Kano to beat. In my opinion this is the second best series I ever seen the eptiome of anime .
                  I think one should just watch Bebop to see why it's so loved after all these years :) my incoherent words are not enough.",10,KonekoHime,
1,"
                It is very easy to see why Cowboy Bebop took off so well in the United States and western world. The show is formatted in the same way that American animation is, for example Family Guy and Spongebob Squarepants. There is no true consistent plot conflict throughout the 26 episodes, practically every episode is a new thing happening. Going in this was unexpected for me, never having experienced an episodic anime. I dropped it after 3 episodes because it just felt bland and pointless.
But once you realize what it is, then it is easier to enjoy. The super fun Bebop crew and new action-adventure in
                  every episode made it a unique viewing that I had not previously experienced with Japanese anime. Edward and Spike are just awesome at all times, but sadly Faye tends to fall on the more annoying side. The vague ""Syndicate plot"" that spanned across the show was pretty disappointing, and the ending just hurt without feeling full-filling. I didnt really feel like any characters arc concluded in the best way it could have. Edward should not have ran off with her dead beat dad, Faye took farrrr too long to change personalities, and Spike's death felt extremely unnecessary. 
Considering how similiar it is to Western animation, I think the show is best compared to Star Wars: Clone Wars. It is an extremely fun, exciting, sometimes comedic show that shouldn't be taken too seriously. For what it is, it is amazing. But it is a pretty basic show that is tough to be considered a masterpiece with how much plot convenience and the weak main plot it has.",7,CickNipolla,
1,"
                this show is a touchy subject I find with a lot of anime fans. Me myself, I had always heard of this show growing up and thought it was boring as balls. Or I was too busy watching DraginBallZ. But now that I've matured, and had the chance to buy this show and watch it to it's fullest potential, I gotta say, it was one great investment. let's jam!
Story:
Well the story of Cowboy Bebop is pretty simple, a group of bounty hunters who want to do nothing more than make enough money to at least not starve to death in the galaxy. But the other
                  half of the story is how each character  has a past that will come back to haunt them. See the story to Bebop is both awesome and hard to get people to watch. As I had watched GRarkada's review on it before watching it, he said the first four episodes would be a snooze compared to what the other episodes had in store for you. so if you want my recommendation it will be the same as his because it worked for me. watch episodes 5, then 6, then go back and watch episodes 1-4 and watch 7 all the way to the end. Trust me, it works.
Animation:
You gotta remember this show came out in 1998 and ended in 1999 people, you aren't getting any PA works animation here. But if you look at other anime from the time the show is pretty high standard for the time. The other good note for the animation, one being my personal thing that I like, is that the animation made the character's and their look feel bluesy. Another good note worth mentioning is that the action scenes are very smooth in execution, which is great cause that is one the best parts of the show is the action. 
Sound:
The sound in Cowboy Bebop is easily where this show shines the most, not even up for debate. This is the show that has one of THE best English dubs of all time, and if it's not the best, then it damn well was the first before this dub, dubs were SHIT! Steve blum as Spike Spiegel sealed the along with Bo billanger as Jet, and the voices of faye and ed were amazing as well (forgot the actress's names.) However as good as the dub is, the music in Bebop is just as perfect as well. the show has an amazing selection of music from jazz, to blues, being the genres the show has the focal point on, to even some metal tracks, nice acoustics, you name it, it's got it. Fun fact, the names of the episodes are musically inclined as well, such as bohemian rhapsody and heavy metal queen. absolutely amazing soundtrack.
Characters:
All the characters in Bebop are very well flushed out, and all very entertaining in their own way. The main character Spike, is as badass and to the tee of the rule of cool as it comes, Faye, the chick that may not be no martial arts master, but can hold her own with her sassy attitude and sensual trickery, Jet, who is more the wiseman of the group and Ed, the hyperactive comic relief which the show needed to add some color to the Bebop crew's rather down tone sometimes. And it works perfectly because they each bounce off each other so well the chemistry is great.
My personal enjoyment:
In all honesty, as much as I praise the shit out of this show, it's not for everybody. The show is episodic so I can see why people looking for a deep plot wouldn't like it. But if your looking for something simple/epic and fun as hell characters, there is few better to watch than Bebop. overall, it's a classic, and should be viewed as such.",10,alucardmike666,

                [REVIEW WITHOUT SPOILERS]
Cowboy Bebop, a true classic with some so-so's.
THE GOOD'S:
* SOUND: 12/10. Really, can you only give 10 out of 10 for the music here? In Cowboy Bebop, it's the music that takes the stage, and sets the atmosphere of the anime. Music sets the environment, the mood, the spirit, and really makes the anime oozing class. Remember this name: Yoko Kanno, the true musical genius behind. Many times, before or after an episode, I just left the dvd menu on to listen to one of the many terrific tracks. This is really the number one anime of all time as far as soundtrack
                  is concerned, period.
* ART: 9/10. The art is very nice and enjoyable, and marries well with the soundtrack. Consider it is a '98-'99 series, and you see right away how the art is even more remarkable given the time. In any case, even today, it stands very well and helps a lot to define the atmosphere of the series.
THE SO-SO's:
* CHARACTER development and STORY, 6 to 7 on average, more on single episodes.
Some characters are somehow well defined, others are less defined, and this is not helped at all by the story development, which is hardly sufficient. 
The plot goes on using single episodes, self-contained stories: while this helps the casual viewer, and makes for some epic single episodes, it doesn't provide a sufficiently deep storyline, which is a pity given the other merits of this anime. The same ending is rather disappointing, showing that the story writers somehow ""had to"" finish the show, while it absolutely deserved better. It left me a bitter aftertaste, for all the potential not fullfilled.
OVERALL: With its good's and so-so's, this is anyway a classic, must-watch for everyone interested in anime. Sure, it could have been even better, but even with its pitfalls it is a beautiful and innovative series, worth staying in the top's of anime history, and that didn't age.

                Cowboy Bebop is, amongst my group of peers, THE ""introductory"" anime series. Blending a middle-of-the-road animation style that is at the same time distinctly Japanese, while utilizing many camera angles and lighting techniques that will be familiar to any Western viewer.
From the bebop-like introduction music to the english vocal actors for the dub (so excellent as to put any non-cartoon watcher at ease) to the main character, Spike to the unique commercial transition scrrens are understandable enough (and more importantly, interesting enough) to make this the perfect bridge into the anime universe. The only thing that I can say as a word of warning is
                  that introducing someone to anime via Bebop (as happened to me) can create unrealistic expectations within the individual, forcing them to scour the internet in search of anime that is comparable in quality.
What more is there to say? In my mind any and every truly great anime series (and most anime movies) will be held up against Cowboy Bebop for inspection; it is and continues to define what an anime both can be and should be.",10,Puck342,

It’s undeniable that anime as an entertainment medium has a fair number of series that are considered classics. Among these, Cowboy Bebop is a name you hear relatively often. First released in 1998, only its first half was aired initially due to its “adult themes” and today it invokes nostalgia in many viewers. Certainly, compared to other shows of its time it has aged fantastically due to strong characterisation, a tone that stands out from the masses even today and animation that screams “vintage” rather than
                  simply “old”. Now, after having watched Cowboy Bebop myself, I can see why it was so prominent back in its day while still feeling that it doesn’t have the spark needed to be considered truly ageless.
What Cowboy Bebop does really well, in comparison, is its characterisation. They’re deeper than your average fare and consistent to boot, as well as being fun to watch. For all of that, however, they’re not particularly memorable and I put part of that down to the lack of overarching story and part down to the fact that they develop independently of each other rather than via interaction. In the episodes that are important for characterisation, the individual of the hour tends to go off and do their own thing with minimal contact with the rest of the crew. While it reflects their tenuous links to each other well and makes sense, it also renders it harder to make the group as a whole stand out.
Summary – When Cowboy Bebop first aired it would have made major waves, so I have no trouble understanding why viewers still look back on it fondly. The animation and characters have stood the test of time excellently and just about every other aspect of the show could stand up to newer counterparts without shame. Unfortunately, the series as a whole lacks the cohesion granted by overarching plotlines that is needed to really shine and make itself memorable in the current day, and its meagre attempts at cultivating that are more detrimental than enjoyable. Still, if you like more gritty and relatively serious anime then Cowboy Bebop is well worth a try. After all, it’s a classic for a reason.

                I rated this anime by how I watched several anime in the past 2 years. In celebration I am writing this review to start my reviews.
WARNING: Some spoilers ahead.
First of all this Cowboy Bebop is like several anime in the past like Pokemon and Voltes V which makes the debut of the new character or new plot elements to introduce in every episode.
Cowoby Bebop does the same but makes something different out of it. You can call it Sessions.
In this sessions the viewers will watch how several aspects of life, or futuristic aspects implemented in the show. 
In terms of story I enjoyed several nostalgia
                  effects of the books that you may have read or heard about the wild west. Both the art, sound, character resonates with the story as no single narrator is to explain what is happening or what is going to happen to our characters.
This makes Cowboy Bebop a classic with just PURE animation which nobody will not expect what will happen and makes you join the ride in which delves into the deeper themes of the show such as loneliness, future corruption of the environment, and space travelling.
You JUST WATCH and SEE what happens in this show. That's the perfect way to enjoy it. You may need to go back and see it again if you need.",10,LoveComedyWa,
1,"
                Conclusion first so you don't have to scroll:
You can nitpick all you want to give a lower score to this series; but in the end, compared to what the anime industry is putting out, this show is just leagues better - 16 years old and it STILL is better than 99% of the crap that gets aired every year, and it's not even close.
Plot:
People seem to be bothered that there's no overarching ""plot"" to this series, two points on that. First, why would it have one? A former gang member and cop get together to make money, they're not out looking for the galactic leyline
                  - they just need money to eat and pay bills. Second, a ""plot"" in anime is really just an overall goal assigned to the main character while they actually just undergo story arcs; so the only difference between Cowboy Bebop and series with a ""plot"" is that they didn't assign a vague goal to the MC - which is fine since this series has more character development and interesting storylines in its 1-2 episode arcs than most series do over an entire season.
Characters:
This show is all about subtlety; it leaves lots of things unsaid, much like in real life - which is one reason why some feel it is all about style, it isn't. There is just so much more to the lead characters than their appearance leads you to believe, they feel human - something I just cannot say about any other anime, characters are either archetype cardboard cutouts or just so over the top that they don't feel real. 
As a small shallow example: the lead is very much OP yet he still gets his ass handed to several times throughout the series, it makes him more credible as a human whereas other MCs either never lose or lose only to learn a lesson that will make them stronger so that they win next time, neither of those cases feel like actual human beings.
The only disappointments are the antagonists, they just seem evil for no particular reason. 
Oh and the visuals and soundtrack aren't bad either in case you haven't heard.",10,Albatorz,

                I can see why many think that this anime is one of the best off all time. 
I really do. Awesome characters, great music, a cool world, interesting philosophical questions...  An anime truly for adults which avoids many of those typical anime cliches. It has also one of the best/most memorable scene I've seen ever in an anime. (Session 5)
Why is it still not a 10/10 Masterpiece?
The overall story was really lacking which prevented me to be more involved with the characters. And most of of the episodes where just good.

                Cowboy Bebop, it's really my first anime (if I don't include Pokémon, my awareness of anime was zerozerozero when I was 10 or so). And I loved every second of it. You should just watch it for the amazing music, and then realise: wow, it's just a great series.
The story: Well, it is about a handsome man-in-suit, Spike Spiegel, who has to settle something with his former-friend Vicious; and of course, it's about a woman. But don't think: Aw, again one of those shallow crappy animes! Did I tell you it is set in the future? I never really liked all those machinie-space-let'sliveonotherplanets-thingies. Cowboy Bebop
                  is somewhat different, although I can't explain it very well. 
The art: This is not the best drawn anime ever, I can name 10 other anime whose art is better and such, but it fits the series. The universe-stuff with all the flying vehicles it pretty realistic and the fights are nice.
The music: Aahh, the music. Yoko Kanno is a real music genius. There are sad melodies, but also very funky, jazzy themes. Especially jazz.
The characters: You get every one of them. Spike, the cool, laid-back man, who'll do everything for the woman he loves.'

                Well, it's official.  Cowboy Bebop is the greatest anime series of all time.  Well, ok, that may be a bit of a hyperbole, but not much of one.  It has a legendary status that the latest shonen idiot-fest, the most popular shojo pretty-boy romp, or even series' like Death Note or Code Geass can never hope to achieve.  If you like anime, you've at least watched Cowboy Bebop.  If you haven't, what the hell are you waiting for?  Even if you don't end up liking it (despite my gushing about it, it can be a real love it or
                  hate it thing), you should at least give it a watch once in your life.
This show has also had a massive impact on the anime industry.  Various members of the production team for this show banded together to form a little studio named Bones.  They're the masterminds behind not only the Cowboy Bebop movie, but also Wolf's Rain, RahXephon, Eureka Seven, Ouran High School Host Club, and of course Fullmetal Alchemist (as well as the direct manga adaptation, FMA Brotherhood).  Yes, both of the FMA anime were made possible because of Bebop.
I'd go into depths of why it's so good, but it's been beaten to death and beyond.  Suffice it to say that the story is wonderful, the characters are some of the best and most memorable ever, the animation is flawless, the English dub is ridiculously awesome, and the music is done by Yoko Kanno (no explanation needed).  If I can think of one flaw, it's that the episodes Wild Horses and Boogie Woogie Feng Shui are pretty weak in comparison to the rest of the series, which is bizarre considering that interspersed between those two are Pierrot le Fou and Cowboy Funk, two of the strongest episodes in the series (ESPECIALLY Cowboy Funk).

                  to do mostly with Spike and his past, although the other characters get their time in the limelight too. My only complaint is how the cast even after splitting up always seem to find each other in the end. They can travel the whole solar system, so it's a coincidence that happens a tad too often.  Lastly, this show has such an amazing ending that you can't help but love.
Characters - 34/35 - One of the best cast of characters you could ask for. They all just work so well together, and a very fun to watch. Spike in particular is very cool, and is probably the single coolest character in all of anime. The rest of the cast aren't slouches either, as they all have their good points. Even though we do learn a lot about their past and see them form a relationship with each other, I can't help but feel there is more to tell for each of them. The side characters are also very good, as is the main villain. 
Sound - 15/15 - Arguably the best soundtrack in any show ever. I really love the score from this show, from its iconic opening, to all the jazz spread through the show, to the ending. Each episode has a specific genre associated to it, and it's cool to see the music change along with the episode. Also, it's probably the best example of English used properly in anime, and sounding VERY good and NOT like it's a separate language. 
As you probably know, the dub for this show is phenomenal, and should be watched over the sub. Even if you are a sub purist, watch this show dubbed. 
Animation - 13/15 - The best of the best for its time. Sadly, its time was 1999, which was a while ago. It still looks beautiful and has very fluid movements, but it is still older. 
Overall - 93/100 - Damn this was a good show. Easily one of the best I have ever seen, and one everybody should see. Don't miss this show.",10,Mazzmoney,

                I heard about this anime a long ways back from several people all saying it was good. It wasn't like I doubted them but I just couldn't bring myself to watch a show called 'Cowboy Bebop'... Well I eventually gave in (must be about 10 years later) and I have just finished watching the series.
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. Just about every episodes is a fun and exciting watch with a bit of comedy here and there.
I wouldn't say there is any overall story to this anime but each character has his/her own story going on and we learn a little about each throughout the
                  series, but never really dive deep into any of them apart from perhaps Spike. Spike reminded me alot of Mugen from Samurai Champloo - his looks, his attitude, highly skilled fighter etc so I think I enjoyed his character and story the most. Again it didn't go very deep into his story/past but it didn't really need to, to be enjoyed.
All the characters have their quirky little traits that make them all the more loveable and entertaining to see in various situations.
The English dub is not as cringe worthy as most anime I have seen but its still pretty horrible IMO. I dont think the voice for any of the characters in the English dub suited them at all after having watched it in Japanese.
The art work and animation is decent considering its age. Its nothing spectacular but it does the job and fits the general feel of everything being a bit rough and only just maintained to a working condition. The action scenes are great with some cool fights, gunfights and space battles. Most of which are fairly fast paced but easy to follow.
This is definitely one to tick off the list. Don't worry about how old it is - you will enjoy it!",8,Grunkalunka,

                I was drawned to Cowboy Bebop by a Firefly podcast. There is something about space cowboys that I love. Bebop doesn't have a linear storyline it's more about the misadventures of a rag tag crew that is drawn together by there love of money and adventure.  There were no villains per say just &quot;bounties&quot; they tried to capture each episode. One of the things I loved about this series were the characters. They were each unique and very flawed but seemed to care about each other though they would never admit it. Each had a background, that we got to see. Ed the non
                  sequitur, androgynous, young member of the crew was much like River from Firefly. Spike the anti hero is too cool for school. Faye the femme fatale brought sexy to the series and a little girl power. Jet the gruff old goat would bring his sage advice to the crew, even though they never wanted it. Ein the &quot;smart dog&quot; rounded out the crew. The action was good and there was plenty of gun slinging like in old westerns. There were even a couple of duels at dust. What stood out to me was the soundtrack. It was a great jazzy mix. The downside to this series was that there wasn't really an ending no one road out in the sunset. Cowboy Bebop was my first anime and I really enjoyed it.",9,Tonyahuqt03,

                Widely regarded as a gateway anime for many out there, Cowboy Bebop was a critical success and during the early 2000’s created a massive following in the States. Directed by the ever successful Shinichiro Watanabe (Macross Plus) and produced by the massive Studio Sunrise, the budget and talent was there to succeed.
Set in an era where mankind has colonized space and other planets, the story of Cowboy Bebop is told in the storytelling format in episodic fashion. Many anime fault the standalone episode way due to poor character development and lack thereof for any story. In the case of Bebop, this is done to almost
                  perfection with the viewer able to jump into just about any episode. Sometimes an episode will focus on one character just to develop their character and explain their past. Our main characters are bounty hunters, referred to as “cowboys” in which help out tracking down criminals and such to get their payday. The achievement of this series to gain such a connection between episodes and to the characters themselves is what many other anime have trouble doing in a regular story. This speaks volumes to the high quality Bebop has.
Art and sound hits the viewer instantly when the opening to the series begins, and never lets up. Animation still holds up with some of the best ever. Compared to an anime like Outlaw Star which was running at the time shows volume to how high Bebop set the bar. Sound and music were very unique where a band was literally created for the show. Its’ mixture of rock, blues, and jazz somehow matches the space action, and even the drama the anime sets in between. Not many anime can honestly hold up animation or even for the music to be so memorable. Even the voice acting, whether it’s watched in Japanese or English, is also among the best example set in anime. Mixing in the sound effects ranging from crazy gun fights to the waves hitting rocks in the sea, almost everything in this anime is done to almost perfection.
Considered an anime classic, it is hard to argue why. The only fault that Cowboy Bebop has is the lack of a continuous story, but that’s not what this sci-fi western adventure is. If that isn’t what a fan is into then still give Cowboy Bebop a chance at the very least. There is so much to love and being one of the most watched anime of all time, it’s easy to see why.",9,BowlingJD,

                Writing mini reviews or my initial reactions to each episode and stating my overall opinion of the show as I watch it for the first time.  The end will have a full score.  I haven't done this type of thing before, so bear with me.  Watching this Dubbed BTW.
Sessions 1&2:  The intro is amazing, but what's up with the voice acting?  Other than that, it's just alright.  What's with the hype though?  4/10
Session 3: The art style is actually really nice actually.  5/10
Session 4:  The voice acting is getting better, and I actually see hints of
                  something great. 6/10
Session 5: I can't do this episode justice.  The whole episode is amazing, giving a backstory and some new information.  The art here is amazing, but by far the best part is the music.  I had no idea Green Bird was from Cowboy Bebop.  Explains why the rest of the music is so amazing.  9/10
Session 6: This keeps up the quality established in session 5.  Interesting premise, and satisfying conclusion.  9/10
Session 7:  This episode is pleasantly interesting.  The music and comedy are great, and the characters are too.  You get a bit more information on the characters, and it's nice to see a show which gets space right for once!  9/10
Session 8:  Did... Did they actually get paid for once? 10/10!!  But really, this is another great episode.  Even the side characters are multifaceted, not to mention Spike.  9/10
 Session 9: 2001 reference in the hostile AI?  Who is this annoying kid?  Why does Earth look so weird?  Oh so the kid is a hacker, alright.  The music at 12:35 is great.  Oh shit the kid's a recurring character.  At least it seems that the music will return.  9/10
Session 10:  It was great to learn about Jet and his past.  I'm liking the characters more and more as the show goes on.  9/10
Session 11:  This episode seems to play with genres in a really fluid way.  Impressive.  9/10
Session 12:  It's a little thing, but I enjoy how locations in this series are generally accurate, not including obvious changes for science fiction's sake.  I'm beginning to really like the story here too.  9/10
Session 13:  Part 2... Interesting.  Everything about this 2-Parter is insane.  I'm starting to understand the hype around this show now.  10/10
Session 14:  Shit she's not dead.  This episode seems pretty normal, so I want to use this time to mention how amazing the setting is.  The technology seems actually reasonably accurate for 2071.  Intrasolar-system travel in large, bulky ships.  The warp gates are the only thing which seems outlandish, but otherwise most everything makes sense.  10/10
Session 15:  Ein is the best character.  Oh look a Faye backstory.  54 years, 20, 2071... Huh.  So we know lots about Faye, enough to be completely confused about Spike, and nothing about Jet.  10/10
Session 16:  Jet episode!  Jetisode!  11/10!
Session 17:  Oh no an Ed episode.  I hope he dies in that desert.  Shrooms.  Actually I think I like Ed, I can't tell if she's a genius or an idiot though.  10/10    
Session 18:  This entire episode is enjoyable simply for the fact that something which originally released while VHS was dominant has an episode about how antiquated it is.  (Technically a Betamax I know) 10/10
Session 19:  Another interesting episode.  I love seeing the old tech again!  10/10
Session 20:  Balloon man?  This episode seems almost like a horror premise.  What the hell is happening here? 10/10
Session 21:  Another episode about Jet?  Use it on Gloom!  They haven't really done anything They haven't really done anything special since Jupiter Jazz, so I'm not sure if I can still give it a ten.  9/10
Session 22:  Yeah this episode could only have been made before 2001.  Oh shit he's voiced by Mr. Turner, he's definitely an idiot.  This was an entertaining episode.  9/10
Session 23:  The Satire in this episode's beginning is greohh is that Faye?  NO NOT BIG SHOT!  Oh shit it's Heaven's Gate isn't it!  Applewhite = Banana?  Oh this is highly relevant to today, interesting.  This episode was really self aware, and seemingly timeless in influences.  This is another favorite episode for me I think.  9/10
Session 24:  This episode has so much character development with only 2 episodes left.  This is another great episode.  The music is used particularly well here too.  This episode's ending is really bittersweet, but in a great way not many shows can achieve.  10/10
Session 25&26:  There's only a short time left, so of course this will get real interesting.  The past is catching up to everybody, it seems.  A killer ending.  I have NEVER seen a better ending to an anime, show, or movie.  This ending is ambiguous, which is only fitting for a show which so nearly mirrors and satirizes life.   
It took 6 years, but a show has finally supplanted Scientific Railgun as my favorite anime.  The soundtrack, the characters, the art, the storytelling, everything.  I have found shows which equal it in nearly every category:  Nichijou in art, Initial D in soundtrack, various shows in storytelling, but nothing has ever combined it all into one like this.  I started the show expecting to dislike it.  It's just how I always go into popular shows.  I cannot fully do this show justice.
I usually feel upset when a show ends.  I feel a sort of emptiness, a ""well now what?"" feel?  I didn't get that with this.  Everything was wrapped up perfectly.  It also helps that this show wasn't going into the future, but reflecting on the past.  I'm not sad that there will never be a second season.  In fact, I'm glad.  There are very few shows that can keep up quality beyond 26 episodes, and those that do still will never have an ending quite like this. 
I'll be carrying that weight, but I'll certainly have this show to carry with me.",10,maxeraturee,
1,"
                This show is truly a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. Its entire story is so unique, with each character with a different background story and fate, along with each episode that's about something really different and never having the same old story like most anime shows have. It's even one of the very few shows that actually has a terrific soundtrack. It gotten me into jazz and now I'm a fan of the Seatbelts. Cowboy Bebop and its legacy always keeps my eye caught for it's such a classic.
Each character has a different personality: from a laid-back, karate artist to a seductive gambler to a genius teenager and
                  more! Each episode has a different story: from chess to metal to tragedy, whatever! What I love about the anime is that it does have a love story behind it, but it's not full-out predictable and it doesn't flood the show, unlike other animes.
I also feel connection to the show, especially Spike, since he reminds me so much of myself: laid back, mellow, yet independent, stubborn and sometimes lazy. Even the story about Spike's eyes; it's incredibly personal to me.
If you're looking for a complete unique show with things you've never seen before, then this show is for you! Highly recommended!",10,TheAngryAngel,

                I'd say for 18 years or so, most everyone Ive known that likes Anime always ranks this as their favorite Anime. Some people love it to ridicules levels. I had a friend hand one of our friends Cowboy Bebop to watch and his exact words were
""This is the best Anime ever made all other anime will suck after you see it"" 
I found that to be a bit pretentious 
Now I've seen parts of it back when it use to air on adult swim many years ago and infact bought it and it sadly sat unwatched for many years. Maybe i didnt watch it because
                  i wouldnt think it was the ebst Anime ever and have to listen to my friends drone on how wrong I was. 
Well enough droning on and ill get to my thoughts on it now.
Its an ok Anime
There are some great things about it. Like the Music is great I like how its a mix of many different things that somehow combine into one very well. The Voice acting is pretty solid > i really like the art style and animation. Characters are alright Some cool action scenes, which some look very stylistic.
My problem comes from the fact that the overall story just sucks because its mainly a single story episode show. Most episodes are heres are bounty, lets go get them and some of those stories are alright. When it does back stories on the characters thats good stuff but for an over all plot...eh... I had a hard time getting myself to watch the next episode. I felt like I had to force myself just so I could get this anime done so I could move on. I'd watch about 2-3 episodes at a time. Then when the enxt day came I was like well I need to finish it not really wanting to invest my time into it.
Thats a very bad sign when you are watching a show. They have no real hook or and overall goal that you need to see the next episode to see how they progress or who's the bad guy in all this or some kind of Hook that grabs you and pulls you in and you HAVE to see that next episode to see what happens next. To me an Anime that grabs you like that because you want to know more and then blows your mind when you find out is a great anime.
I feel like most of the ingredients are here for this to be a great anime it just forgot a great story. Sorry for those of you who love this and prize this as the GOAT

                Overview:
As one of the most famous anime of the 1990's, ""Cowboy Bebop"" is a show that needs no introduction. With that in mind, there is almost no need to write this review other than to state my own personal opinion. With its smooth, detailed animation, highly unique music style, awesome action scenes, flawless voice acting and quirky yet lovable characters, ""Cowboy Bebop"" is a brilliant crime fiction/space western series that deservedly became an instant classic.
Story & World (8.5/10):
The series takes place in the year 2071, roughly sixty years after an accident with a hyperspace gateway made the Earth uninhabitable. Because of this incident, humanity has
                  colonized most of the rocky planets and moons of the Solar System. Amid a rising crime rate, the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) set up a legalized contract system, in which registered bounty hunters (also referred to as ""Cowboys"") chase criminals and bring them in alive in return for a reward. The crew of the titular spaceship Bebop are a group of such bounty hunters. Originally, the crew consists only of our main character, Spike Spiegel and his partner Jet Black, but with the first nine episodes, three new members join the crew. The series has a largely episodic nature that follows this group of misfits hunting down criminals while also covering their day-to-day lives.
One thing you'll notice is that the crew hardly ever get the bounties, often screwing things up by ultimately killing the person or having something else happen. Unfortunately, as you can guess, this can get a bit repetitive, as you begin to expect that they'll end up risking their lives and get absolutely nothing for their trouble. Now and again, however, the show does see them capturing bounties alive, just to show that they're actually good at what they do. And when I say 'a bit repetitive', I mean 'a bit', as the episodes have a wide variety of genres, including film noir, gothic horror, creature-feature, black comedy, screwball comedy, spy action, tragedy, action, philosophy, science, spirituality, buddy-buddy stories, parody and everything in between. One episode might be extremely funny while the next could be highly bleak or unsettling. 
Largely, however, the show doesn't really have a story. While there is two story arcs, they only really come in when needed and often go several episodes without being touched upon. I felt that Spike's arc, which focuses on his past as a criminal, was quite underdeveloped as a lot of things aren't really made clear. Thankfully, I can say that the ending of the series as a whole is absolutely fantastic.
Art & Animation (9/10):
""Cowboy Bebop""'s animation is extremely smooth. While there are better-looking anime out there, the fights are brilliantly choreographed and, for a hand-drawn series, the characters and environments are all incredibly detailed, with everyone and everything having a distinct appearance. All of this creates a fantastic-looking anime that still holds up even to this day. Considering the show first aired in the late 90s, that is quite an accomplishment.
Sound & Dialogue (10/10):
My God, the music is absolutely fantastic! It is a very unique style that really fits the tone of the series. I cannot think of a single other anime that uses jazz music, and it's used to full effect here. There is only one opening and one ending theme ('Tank!' and 'The Real Folk Blues', respectively) but they are both two of the best themes for an anime I have ever seen. The voice acting is just as good, with the English dub being known for one-upping the Japanese original. I especially like Steven Blum and Wendee Lee's performances as Spike and Faye, respectively. The former has a really cool voice which really fits Spike's laid-back personality and the latter pulls off Faye's feminine charming perfectly. The script is great as well, largely thanks to Spike's brilliant snarky quips.
Characters (9/10):
The Bebop crew can be summed up as follows- the grumpy, sarcastic guy (Spike), the femme fatale (Faye), the wise mentor (Jet), the dog (Ein) and the kid (Ed, who is a girl, btw). However, there is far, far more to them than just that. Spike is a former criminal haunted by the lost of a loved one, Faye is an amnesiac con artist, Jet is a former cop with a robot arm and acts as Spike's foil, Ein is a lab experiment to create a very intelligent dog and Ed is an expert hacker with a... very odd thought pattern.
All of the Bebop crew have their moments in the sun, with various episodes focusing on a specific member. Spike's past catches up to him and he forced to face off against his former best friend-turned-enemy Vicious (more on him later), Faye attempts to recover her lost memory and Jet is forced to deal with various issues from his past as a cop. Ed and Ein don't get as much focus as the core trio, and the episodes that focus on them tend to be very comical.
All of the Bebop crew are lovable in their own ways, but Spike and Faye are by far the most developed. Ed and Ein remain pretty much the same throughout the entire series and while Jet goes through several instances of cleaning up his own past, it doesn't really affect his outlook and lifestyle, with him still being the same gruff but gentle giant. Spike and Faye, on the other hand, are the focus of the major story arcs of the series, with Spike looking for his lost love and settling his score with Vicious and Faye attempting to recover her memory and find her place in the universe. While they remain rather grumpy and unpleasant even to the end, they do definitely care for each other and their shipmates. Plus, they (along with Jet) can more than hold their own in a fight.
This brings us to the main villain, Vicious, a ruthless crime lord who most certainly lives up to his name, as he is notorious for betraying anybody even remotely close to him. He also has legendary skill with a katana, to the point that he manages to make a sword vs. gun fight between him and Spike seem fair, albeit with a bit of cheating on his part. He appears in a total of five episodes and is the only recurring antagonist in the series. That said, some other villains do leave lasting impression even though they only appear in one episode. That is very difficult to do. 
Enjoyment (9.5/10):
Due to the variety in the episodes, you are unlikely to ever be bored while watching ""Cowboy Bebop"". Even if you aren't a big fan of anime, you can still really enjoy this series due to it being largely Western-styled. Some of the episodes, however, especially the last four, are very unsettling and may put off some people. Others, on the other hand, are incredibly funny, so essentially there's something here for everyone.
Overall:
The fact that ""Cowboy Bebop"" is just as popular today as it was when it first aired nearly twenty years ago easily cements its status as a timeless classic, and, having watched it myself, I can easily see why. Fluid animation, awesome music and memorable characters make this one of my favourite anime thus far. If, by any chance, you haven't watched this series, I would recommend you do so as soon as possible.

There are many reasons why this is one of my favorites. Spike had many enlightening points that he makes that causes an impact on your way of thinking. Ed and Ein shaved off a sliver of my heart when she says 'Father persons gone.'

What makes an anime unforgettable? Characters, to be short and thick. Cowboy Bebop is one of the best animations of all time because, in its 26 episodes of 20 minutes each, it manages to reach the soul of the spectator in edges that the spectator himself was unaware of being possible to be reached, even more by a work designed. Shinichiro's anime has style - a lot of jazz! -, humor and drama pervaded by quality and especially of a tone of its own, standing out on any list of best anime and making it unique.
In this sense, the design owes much
                  to its beautiful technical aspects. The animation of the action scenes, especially in Spike's fight scenes and in space duels, is breathtaking, especially given the year of the 1998 anime release. It goes so far as to outdo many (!) Current animations. Example of this soon sees in the first episode, where we know the style of the hairy and lazy Spike - an unforgettable image, although banal. Combining such quality with creativity in architecting an incredible range of scenarios, ranging from the most megalomaniac to the intimate.

                Where to start on this one?  Putting aside all jokes and the renown the show has Cowboy Bebop is not an easy reviewed title.  
If you've been a fan of anime for a while there's a good chance you already know what I am about to say.  Cowboy Bebop is great, and if you have not tried it yet I'd recommend at least going through it once.  
STORY and THEMES
The story to Cowboy Bebop is rather straight forward at first glance.  You simply follow the lives, of at the start two bounty hunters.  But eventually what seems like a
                  straight forward story will eventually unwind into a more complex commentary on many common and uncommon themes, while never abusing the main story.  Whether its the display and contemplation of immortality in Episode 6, or the themes of friendship and betrayal in the 2 Episodes of Jupiter Jazz, you can tell that there is more than just a simple love/revenge story.  You can get something out of every episode and I think that helps the show stand out as a whole.  With its episodic formula of following different stories in each new episode (Discounting Jupiter Jazz, and The Real Folk Blues) many may be turned off.  But the fact that they use these stories to teach something or add to the experience, makes the system  not only work, but become ideal for the show.  
SETTING/SOUND/ART
The setting is honestly one of the best I've ever come across in an anime.  The pseudoscience and spaceship designs make any astrophysics nerds (Such as myself) already love the show right off the bat.  The perfect blend of early 20th century wild west themes and a sci-fi setting help set the show apart from any other.   The sound is amazing, it has one of the best sound tracks I've ever heard.  I think this is most prominent in the last few episodes especially the song jazz rock song ""Real Folk Blues"".  The art is godly.  While being an older anime some characters may look off or slightly disproportionate the scenic scenes are drawn with such detail its awe inspiring.
CHARACTERS 
The character development in this show is amazing.  Without giving too much away it is obvious you can see characters develop and start caring for one another.  And when a character is in peril you feel like there's something at risk.  Combine all this with good comedy from each character and you get a lovely cast of characters that becomes very likable later in the show.
TD;LR  If you haven't already give this one a watch, you should.   I promise it won't disappoint.  Everyone has their own taste, and Bebop knows this it has something for everyone in the show, and I personally love the show.  I watched it subbed, but the dubbed is adequate.  Just give it a watch, it won't disappoint

Total Overall: 8.4/10
Overall Rating: 8/10Overall, very enjoyable show. I’d definitely recommend it to people that haven’t watched it before. I won’t go so far as to say it was a masterpiece; Overall , it was very good with some great moments/aspects sprinkled in to make it worth the watch.
I felt like I grew attached the the crew characters stories and loved their interactions with each other. Its difficult to describe more, other than that (at least in the dub version I watched) their interactions with each other flow extremely well every scene they're in. I liked the fact that Spike meets so many different kinds of people throughout the anime.
I think this anime’s best points were its variety in terms of episodes, and also its excellent atmospheres and ESPECIALLY the great musical scores and how they were incorporated with specific animated sequences. The sheer amount of varied characters, personality wise and appearance wise, was especially cool.
The “main"" story-line was only a few episodes, the story there was pretty interesting and fun to watch but honestly nothing revolutionary. Same with the episodes that focused on the background of the crew members. The other mini stories presented were usually pretty fun and/or quite interesting to watch but sometimes weren’t that enticing.
My favorite episode was probably Ballad of Fallen Angels, I liked it more than Jupiter Jazz 1 and 2, and I think it just ever so slightly edges out The Real Folk Blues 1 and 2. Other than that I really like the VCR tape episode for its unexpected very well executed ending minutes.
I liked the fact that this show had silly episodes where you could just kick back and enjoy the antics that the crew got themselves into, and at the same time having those serious episodes sprinkled in that really hit home in a good way. Even in some of the silly episodes it was really cool to see some things that have deeper meaning, or you find elements in them that hit you in the feels.
The most glaring negative aspect of this anime that some of the episodes seemed to be rather boring to me. But these were generally few and far between. Well that and what I mentioned before, the main plot isn't super exciting. I'll also say that the main character's backgrounds are really not explored to a very satisfying level, its not that the characters don't feel fleshed out in the show, it's just that I would have really appreciated more in depth back story about all of them to make me care about them more.
Ultimately , Cowboy Bebop is a damn good, solidly enjoyable, and unique experience that I think every anime fan really should have on their watched list.",8,midnightblade,

                I really didn't think that this anime would turn out to be one of my favorites, there's nothing negative about this anime, it's just perfect. If you're thinking about whether to watch this or not, I would say go for it, this won't disappoint you. (only 26 episodes).
This 90s classic anime starts with the episodic format where the main characters Spike Speigel and Jet Black catch their bounties and live with that money (Woolongs). Each episode comes up with a masterful plot in the same while introducing the other two main characters and our antagonist. We will get to know our Bebop gang's backstory as
                  the story goes on, we'll be introduced to a wide range of characters with whom our gang members had a past.
The anime is futuristic and adds all the elements to it as they should instead of dragging it. All the characters are likable, the music is too good and the ending is the best.

                Cowboy Bebop is set in the future well intergalactic travel is normal and everyone has their own spaceship. Spike Spiegel and his partner Jet Black are two bounty hunters and owners of the spaceship Bebop. Later joined by Faye Valentine, Ed and Ein, the group fly around in space, taking on bounties to survive. Each bounty they take is more trouble than they are worth but they take them with good hearts and a good sense of humor. You learn more and more about each character as the series rolls on a grow strongly attached to each of them by the end.
The series is very
                  episodic in a way that each episode has no real relation to each other, except the double part episodes. There isn't really a story to be told aside from the group hunting bounties and Spike dealing with his past. That is the reason it took me so long to watch this series. Although I enjoyed watching the characters and their adventures, I found it rather hard to start the next episode. There wasn't exactly a draw that hooked me into watching it. That, however was my only problem with the series. Aside from that, I thought it was absolutely fantastic.
The characters are absolutely phenomenal. Many episodes explain more about each characters past and makes you grow attached to each other them. I can't say there was a character that I disliked from this series as they were all so different and so interesting to watch. My personal favorite was Faye. I don't want to give anything away, but she has a couple rather interesting episodes that bring tears to my eyes. Each character has somewhat of a sad past, each of them having someone they loved and lost and rediscovering them in different ways. 
I watched it dubbed because I heard that the dub was amazing and many say even better. I thought it was great, no complaints at all. It's not in a setting where Japanese culture matters, I suppose. The music is jazzy and the intro will be stuck in my head for the rest of my life. I don't care too much for art from the 90's but for an anime from 1998, I thought it looked amazing. One thing I do want to point out though, was that everyone in the anime appeared human. I don't know exactly how much of space they explored or how many planets they go to, but everyone was human. It's not a complaint or anything, just pointing that out.
Aside from the patchy story, I thought Cowboy Bebop was an amazing anime. It was really entertaining, the action is violent, the characters are lovable, the humor is rich, pretty much everything you could ask for.
Likes:
-All the characters were fantastic, learning about a characters backstory is something I love and Cowboy Bebop explains each of theirs incredibly well.
-""SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY..."" was something I loved seeing at the end of each episode, it's so small and simple yet I absolutely loved it.
-I really wish I could fly around in space and hunt bounties across the stars
Dislikes:
-The ending really bothered me, not exactly the ending really, but what happens leading to the ending. If that makes sense.",9,Caked_Bookies,

                Ah Cowboy Bebop, this was an anime that was important for me being the anime fan I am today. Back in 2008, I quit watching anime for a number of reasons but then I watched Bebop back in 2012 and then I slowly got back into the medium again. This and Ghost in the Shell Standalone Complex were the two shows that helped me get back into it. This is going to be both a write up and a review, and this will kind of pain me to say but after watching the show again, I think it's a 6 out of 10. 
Introductions out
                  of the way, I don't think Bebop is a *bad* show, I think it's decent but it really is mostly a style over substance show. I don't like it when people critique any piece of media that way since you need both style and substance to make an entertaining story, but Bebop is mainly carried by its style more than anything else. If the show didn't have the animation that it did, if the music didn't fit the scenes as well as it did, and if the dub was off in any way, the show would not have the following that it has. The best way to describe Cowboy Bebop is that it's a bare minimum comfort food story done with style that sneaks in a more interesting episode here and there. 
I might as well get into the most debateable aspect of Bebop that either make or break the show for some people is well, the episodic standalones. Fact of the matter is, Cowboy Bebop doesn't really have a serial narrative that you expect a lot of an anime to have, it has a number of episodic standalones that has either nothing to do or vaguely something to do with the main plot. Here is the thing, I am not against this style of storytelling, in fact, as someone who wants to be a fictional writer, I find when a writer can pull this kind of story telling off to be an impressive feat. Mainly in that he has to find a way to get a viewer invested within a short time of 22 minutes, I think the Simpsons, ""Homer's Enemy"" and the various episodes of the Boondocks do this sort of thing very well. Here's the problem with Bebop's standalones, while most of them aren't bad, none them really stand out in any way either. Outside of Mad Pierrot and Cowboy Andy, I can't think of many that really click with me. Mad Pierrot being an interesting thriller story of sorts and Cowboy Andy being a funny parody on the Western. The rest of the standalones? Outside of ""Gateway Shuffle"", ""Heavy Metal Queen"", ""Toys in the Attic"", and ""Boogie Woogie Feng Shui"", the episodes are mostly serviceable comfort food at best. I can see why Adult Swim still plays this series to this day because back in the days of only having TV channels late at night, Bebop would probably be a good show to watch to have the time pass by. The biggest problem with the episodic standalone episodes I feel is that they revolve around too many of the same concepts like, ""good people in bad situations"", ""wacky hijinks"", or just introducing a new concept out of nowhere in every episode. The writing never makes a point or a message that would last with me, and that is fine, but considering the acclaim this series gets, I was expecting more. 
Next point, the sci fi setting, I think it's pretty obvious that Shiniciro Wantanabe is a big fan of movies and not just westerns either, he likes all kinds of genres like film noir, gangster movies, cyberpunk stories, sci fi horror, buddy cop stories, war epics, family movies and so on. I feel that Bebop was better off being just a gangster story and removing all the other genres and sci fi setting that the series pays homage to because the gangster narrative with Spike, Vicious and the Syndicate I felt was the most interesting part, but the series forgets about that a lot of time just to pay subpar tributes to different kinds of storytelling and movies. When I got to Ballad of Fallen Angels I am like, ""I want to know more about Vicious and what his deal was, more about Mao, more about Annie, more about the whole power struggle with rival crime syndicates and why Vicious took that moment to want to kill Spike and killed Mao, what Mao and Spike's relationship was. Ballad of Fallen Angels as the 5th episode and it felt like there could've been more set up to it. I felt if Bebop was more about this and was a toned down on the episodic standalones, the show would be better for it. 
This is going to be a weird comparison but I always felt Cowboy Bebop was the Jak 3 of anime. Both forget what they are, one being a gangster tale and the other being a 3D platformer and the best parts of both are when they remember to be those things. 90% of the run time of both is spent being subpar versions of other kinds of genres in their respective mediums. It is rather strange how the former is considered to be the greatest anime ever while the other is considered to be the ""worst"" in its trilogy and is considered to be a game with a cult following. 
Let's talk about Bebop as a serial narrative...or what little there is of one. The series throws a lots of concepts at the viewer like cowboys, animal and human experimentation, bounty hunters, immortality, corporation scandals, eco terrorism, cryosleep, assassins, crime syndicates, a corrupt police force, a destroyed earth, techno cults, a war, it has all of these things and all of them don't feel like they bleed into each other that well. The series drops these concepts as soon as they get introduced, as standalone stories they aren't that interesting and as a serial narrative, it just makes the world building a mess and makes me scratch my head every 10 seconds. 
This will now lead into my next two points, the ensemble cast and the character of Vicious. I'll talk about the former first, the series promotes an ensemble cast and makes you think it's about the crew of the Bebop and their adventures together when that isn't true, it's ultimately Spike Spiegel's story and everyone just so happen to a supporting character. Sounds weird? Here is the thing, whenever Bebop has it's episodes resembling a serial plot, half the cast are conveniently written out of the story. Jet never gets involved that much and him and the main antagonist, Vicious don't even exchange dialogue together. ""Radical Edward"" is always never in these episodes with a prominent role because the silly nature of his character would not jell well with the serious episodes of Bebop which is also why he is written out of the story before the series' finale. It's funny how shows like Dragon Ball Z and Naruto get bashed for, ""main character or GTFO"" when Bebop is, ""Spike or GTFO"". And before you bash Goku for being a ""bad dad"" remember Edward's dad ditched him and sent him to a rundown orphanage and then ditches him again and runs away when he sees Ed again, and I am wondering what is the lesson here, Ed realizes his dad is a deadbeat and decides to ditch the Bebop crew? What is the point of that? Okay, back on topic, now here is the biggest problem with the Bebop finale while the ending on its own is decent enough, the stuff leading up to the ending just gets my head scratching. Are some of my major issues with it have to do with the before mentioned ""Spike or GTFO"". Why didn't the finale involve Faye and Jet in any meaningful way? At least DBZ and Naruto would have characters job to opposing force to establish how strong they are. Faye and Jet should've at least participated in the final shootout before Spike fights Vicious, instead of Shin, it should've been Jet. Faye realizing she has nowhere to go could at the very least have her die for Spike to establish how strong their bond has been since being together. Imagine in the first Lethal Weapon where in the finale Murtaugh decides to ditch Riggs after the former saves his daughter, yeah, it wouldn't do a good job at establishing their bond now would it? Instead all the finale of Bebop does is constantly remind you of a character I hardly care about which is Julia. Faye crazes over her, Jet talks about her, Annie's last dying moments is her acknowledging Julia, Vicious wants Julia dead, Spike has a obsession with Julia, this all wouldn't be so bad, if I actually knew more about Julia outside of flashbacks or if Faye and Jet had any agency of their own. 
Now the character that Bebop detractors as here and there they tend to show up tend to criticize, the main antagonist Vicious. Here is the thing, I don't dislike Vicious as much as they do, I think Vicious is both a decent and terrible character at the same time. I only think he is decent because of his voice actor in English because he does a good job at carrying a lot of this material and the way he talks and delivers his lines gives a lot of character that the actual story doesn't really give him. Ignoring him, what was Vicious' plan outside of killing Spike? Why did he want to kill the Red Dragon elders so badly? Why did he testify against Gren? Why does he go after Spike on occasion? Why are those henchmen who helped with the coup so loyal to Vicious? Why does he never go after other members of the Bebop to get to Spike? I can go on, but I felt Vicious as a villain was wasted potential, if the series just committed to the gangster narrative, then maybe there would've been more character and even him having more agency in the story. 
Overall, I feel Cowboy Bebop should've been a maybe a 10 episode OVA rather than an anime series, it would feel less bloated and the storytelling would be tighter overall. Note I don't think Bebop is bad, I think it has too many issues that prevent from being an anime I consistently enjoy or an anime where I don't have to zone out during over half its run time. That and I feel the show's mostly critical immunity has gotten me more critical on it in general.",6,Civilwarfare101,
1,"
                Going into this series, I was expecting a lot. I was consistently hearing that this was one of the all time greatest animes. I also kept hearing how great its English Dub is, so of course I watched it dubbed. It 's also the first series I've watched to follow a episodic narrative design, where each episode was treated like a miniature movie. This anime was directed by Shinichiro Watanabe who would also later direct other highly praised shows such as Samurai Champloo and Space Dandy. So after finally getting to watch this legendary series here's what I thought of it.
Story:9/10
Brilliantly written and very sophisticated.
                  The series mainly revolves around the main characters' past and it explores that in such a beautiful way. Due to it's narrative design we are given so many memorable episodes with my personal fav being episode 20, ""Pierrot Le Fou,' Each episode contains a different story approach and it gives us different genres. For example there are episodes where we would get 80's action, detective drama, sci fi horror, psychological thrillers, and Chinese martial arts. This gives the series a wide range of variety and mixed tones that helps satisfy many viewers with their own unique tastes and preferences. It's necessary to keep in mind that Watanabe was heavily influenced by American cinema as this has been stated by many of his interviews. And although it doesn't have a strong reliance on action, this series had great and memorable action in particular the shootout scenes. This series also had one of the best conclusions ever, it ended in a bang. As for flaws it's not really a story driven series so there isn't much plot progression. For example the main plot between Spike and the main antagonist are only focused on for a handful of episodes. It also suffered a lil bit from exposition as there were a few things that weren't fully explained.
Art:10/10
This was the one area that impressed me the most. This series came out in the 1990s yet it looks better than most animes I've watched in the 2000s. The animation never lost consistency and it was fluid as water. The movie quality was great as like I said, each episode felt like a short movie. Visuals were great and very detailed and none of the character designs felt out of place. Every character here was drawn in a very realistic way. What's strange about the show is that at first glance it may seem rather bland or limited since it's not heavily action packed. However what the series excels in is not how much movement is going on but how high the quality of each scene has. For example a lot of characters are given specific gestures and postures that helps explain their feelings or personalities; whether it's Spike walking around with a relaxed slouch to potray his chill personality, Jet's more tense upright posture that shows off his maturity, Faye's curvy posing that supports her sexiness, and Ed's constant quirky movements that matches her eccentric character. The distinct body language was a way to help establish its characters and it did it in such an excellent and realistic way.
Sound:10/10
This is where Cowboy Bebop stands out from most animes. For one it has SUPERB voice acting. It wasn't over the top at all and everyone's voice fit and Spike sounded so cool. The dub is so great that I honestly believe it to be superior to the Japanese version. And of course the soundtrack, one of the best any person can hear in ANYTHING. The opening song, ending song, to its beautiful jazz flowing in the background, the music perfectly matched the show's atmosphere. If I was blind and had only my ears, this anime will still heavily satisfy me.
Character:9/10
The development here is incredible but what really stands out is that we really connect wit these characters like their actual people. And really love the relationships between the main characters cuz although they don't always get along their all they have and it leads to some emotional moments. The main antagonist here is great cuz although not overly powerful, the character plays a huge impact on the main character. Whenever these two were together you'll almost cry inside cuz their past is so deep.
Final Verdict
One word, masterpiece. Simply one of the greatest animated works you can ever find. Cowboy Bebop is just too important to the anime world and its one series that all of us needs to see. This series is all about style, and when it comes to style there's no better anime out there than this. With its beautiful animation, great music, and endearing characters, there's no doubt why Cowboy Bebop is considered to be the landmark title in Anime.
Sub or Dub Recommendation: Dub",10,saiyan_og,
1,"
                Number of Episodes: 26 (about 20 minutes an episode)
Plot: A+ *In the future, the Solar System has become accessible to humanity. In the vast openness of space and the emergence of technologies, a bounty hunter society is created resembling America's days in the Wild West. The show follows bounty hunters Jet Black and Spike Spiegel as they go on adventures flying their ship the Bebop across the galaxy trying to collect bounties for woolongs. On their journey, they pick up three new crewmembers named Faye Wong, Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivruski IV (Or just Ed) and Ein. They go on a few wacky adventures, and
                  have some heavy backstory episodes. It's an exciting world with interesting people and a lot of messed up scenarios too.
Visuals: B: It's funny, at first glance, I was bothered with Spike's hair to head size ratio. Now I think has one of the most badass designs for a protagonist ever. It doesn't hurt that his fight scenes are animated very well and he is such a badass. Despite there being prettier looking anime out there, there is a certain charm to this hand-drawn world. My only gripe would be that a lot of the backgrounds tend to be really dark. It reminds me of older episodes of the Simpsons. I feel like it could use more vibrant colors. The dark blues everywhere isn't always the nicest to look at.
Voice Acting: A+ *I can't believe that I once gave this anything less than an A+. So in my defense, Bebop was the 2nd anime that I watched and having a character like Ed in it was startling for me to say the least. But on the rewatch, I didn't mind her voice as much. In fact, I actually enjoyed her antics. But Spike, Jet, and Faye are absolutely perfectly cast. There's a reason that Bebop is considered by many to be one of the best dubs out there.
Film Score/Soundtrack: A+ * All, 4, of the released OST are amazing! My brother ended up asking me if I was stranded on a desert island, what would be the three albums that I  take with me? I cheated a bit, but without hesitation, I said the Bebop OST inferring that I wanted every song from here. He allowed it not realizing that there are 4 disks worth of content on here. But if I really had to choose just 1 of them, I suppose it would have to be Blue which is composed of all the soundtrack songs on the show's OST. It's not that I don't love the show's score, (because I am absolutely obsessed with it and jam with Edward all the time to it) it's just that the Blue album carries a lot of (weight) emotions for me which puts me in a good melancholic mood.
***Favorite Track: Space Lion***
(The fact that I'm able to single out a single song is impressive. Because there are so many great ones. But Space Lion elicits so many strong emotions due to the episode it is played on and because the sax is so Blade Runneresche! ""Oh Ed... anything but blue."")
Characters: A+ *Another category I find funny that I gave anything less than an A+ upon my first viewing. The very strength of Bebop besides the music is the characters. Spike Spiegal might be the most iconic character in the show and in all of anime, but more often than not, he isn't even the main focus of an episode. Jet, Faye, Ed, and even other side characters share the spotlight as their backstories are explored and the world is explored.
Cringeworthy Anime Moments: Well you don't have to worry about unexpected fanservice popping out of nowhere too often in this show because Faye Valentine's ""tatas"" are on display in just about every frame that she's present in. If she didn't have such a well-written backstory and wasn't so entertaining at being a trainwreck, I'd call her walking fanservice but that does an injustice to a great character. The main anime moments on this show that I can think of are the over-the-top eating animations, characters getting angry really quick over dumb arguments, and a few unnecessary boob jiggles from Faye. But other than that, this show is an absolute delight!
Titles:
Opening Titles: A+ *""I think it's time we blow this scene. Get everybody and their stuff together. Ok, 3,2,1 let's jam!"" Talk about a killer first impression. Awesome exciting jazz track with great visuals that got me super excited for the show. One of the best openings to a TV show I've ever seen. Also, love the closer The Real Folk Blues too.
Closing: A+ *The rare anime where you don't skip the intro or the closing track and you sit through every second of it with each episode.
Final Verdict: 8/10 *To a casual observer, Cowboy Bebop is an anime about a plucky group of bounty hunters in space that go on wacky adventures while jazz music plays in the background. And there are a bunch of episodes where that description fits the bill. But Bebop is a much heavier show than meets the eye. Once it starts getting into the backstories of characters which helps to explain their lifestyles and how they came to be the people that they are, that's where we start to really connect with them and see that this fun world that this fun futuristic world that Shinichirō Watanabe and company created is actually more of a dystopia than it is a utopia. That's not to say that there isn't a lot of good in the world of Bebop. But even in a world of space ships, awesome computer technology, and exciting adventures, real human problems (although much more unique than the ones we would face) exist. But of course, in Spike's case, his past is much more complicated and dangerous than any normal person. Lucky for Spike, he is well-equipped to handle it. But how about Faye and her past? How about Jet when he confronts his? How about Ed? What a show!
Favorite Episodes:
Best: Jupiter Jazz Parts 1 and 2 *Incredible set-up for an emotional gut-punch at the end. Having Space Lion play at such a pivotal moment certainly doesn't hurt either. Gren is one of those side characters you just don't forget. It was during these episodes when I realized how much I loved Bebop.
Best Concept: Brain Scratch *A philosophical episode that pokes fun at cults and questions the nature of religion but in a fascinating way by discussing the idea of having the human mind put into a digital world so you can experience immortality and never have to feel your real physical body die. This episode is a much less subtle take on one of the more prevalent themes in the show about whether or not characters are dreaming or if they're living their life in the real world.
Most Emotional: Speak Like a Child *A mysterious tape arrives for Faye and they try to find out what it's purpose is, and when they finally get to play it, it's the closest to a family the crew of the Bebop ever gets. I was damn near moved to tears.
Funniest Episode: Cowboy Funk *I have seen this episode more times than any other and I still am laughing the entire time. Cowboy Andy is the funniest side character in the entire show as a stereotype of American westerns and toxic masculinity, this episode is one you don't take seriously for a single second and you just laugh and enjoy the ride. See you Space Samurai.",10,Lab_Mem_Num001,

                Cowboy Bebop was really one of the first &quot;good&quot; animes I watched right after Gurren Lagann.  And it truly influenced a generation of anime, as well as people.  The story is interesting and involves the pasts of all of the main characters.  The music (composed by Yoko Kanno, one of my favorite artists) is amazing and complements the style of anime that the developers wanted to achieve.  
The art style and graphics are amazing for the time it was made in.  I still love watching the fighting scenes, because they are done so beautifully.  
Overall, Cowboy Bebop has many
                  cultural references, as well as literary references that make the series interesting and intelligent at the same time, which few animes today succeed at.
By far the best anime I have ever watched.",10,Master_Bei_Shun,
1,"
                For those who haven't caught any of the show or the hype, Cowboy Bebop initially involves just two guys, Spike and Jet, who are trying to make a living as interstellar bounty hunters. They travel from system to system trying to earn rewards for bringing in various and sundry criminals in their heap of a spaceship named the Bebop. As their journeys continue, we learn more about their pasts--Jet's life as a cop, and Spike's membership in a crime syndicate--while they meet up with others who become a part of their crew. Faye Valentine's a selfish but beautiful gal who occasionally works with the guys
                  when not gambling or trying to understand the memories of her past that have gone missing. Ed's a she that looks like a he that can hack into any computer system, providing she doesn't giggle and goofytalk her way into oblivion. And Ein's a good-natured data dog with as much personality as his companions in just a simple woof. A ragtag bunch if we've ever seen one, the five nevertheless wind up capturing the imagination and hearts of their audience easily during their 26 episodes of adventures.
I have never seen an animated television series look so fantastic. Almost every episode of Bebop rivals theatrical animation, trouncing on OVAs that supposedly have better budgets. It looks amazing. The soundtrack by Yoko Kanno, a jazz fusion blend, is immediately catchy, but it has surprising depth, enough that the CD has become a regular companion. If you like animation at all, you'll have to see Bebop. And, frankly, it doesn't matter if you are a subtitle purist or a dub fan, because both versions are fantastic. I watch subs almost exclusively, and I got hooked on the dub. That just doesn't happen to me, but it did here. It's that good.
But beyond that, the show has a style and colorfulness lacking in too many anime. True, some shows like Hellsing are drenched in style, but that's all they are. Cowboy Bebop is cool without ever having to rely on attitude alone to see it through. Although I tend to prefer shows with plotlines that build on each other, Bebop grows our affection for the characters through mostly stand-alone episodes. There is back-story to be told, and it's told well, but rarely do shows without a strong story arch feel so natural. It shouldn't be as powerful as it is, but it's a testament to good storytelling.
Then there's that wonderful history and the drastic ending (which I won't spoil here, though I'll discuss it below under the main review). I'm reminded when watching Cowboy Bebop of the tagline from the beautifully haunting film Magnolia: ""We may be through with the past, but the past isn't through with us."" Bebop is effective because each character has such a rich history before the stories here even begin that they are fully realized in every way. Sadly, in most anime, characters exist only to fulfill plot purposes, rather than existing as entities unto themselves. In fact, Bebop works because we go through the entire show, right up to its conclusion, without knowing everything there is to know about these folks. They are motivated by issues that the writers developed that we don't even fully understand. That lends a reality to the characters that makes them far more enjoyable than we expect. When their pasts catch up with them, we care.
This leads us to the controversial part...the last few episodes that wrap everything up. The events of those episodes are cataclysmic, to say the least. For American audiences, they can mar the experience, even. (As one friend said to me, ""Now that I've watched the whole thing, the last couple episodes make me sad, in a way, that I did."") But they are very Japanese, encapsulating the ambiguity and realism that set the very best anime apart. I believe that they make the show even more authentic and worthy. At the same time, the only thing that keeps me from giving the show an A+ is that the ending doesn't have the emotional impact it should because we just don't know quite enough back-story yet for it to work. We are left with too many questions. Again, I attribute it to the fact that Japanese stories are rife with ambiguity. But this one could have stood just a little bit less.
That being said, Cowboy Bebop is easily in my list of ""best anime ever"". If you like anime, you should see it. Period. Normally, I use my final paragraph to sum it all up, but that says it all. You should see it.",9,ItsFapTime,

                When Cowboy Bebop was first showed in the US in 2001 it changed anime in the United States forever. Cowboy Bebop is about 3 bounty hunters, 1 girl, and 1 very smart dog. They go to planet to planet hunting for bountys and getting paid. Cowboy Bebop is a very well writen show and has some great voice acting.
Cowboy Bebop is sometimes very funny, funny, or it trys to be funny and fails. The main characters are very well drawn and voiced. The main characters are Spike and Jet. The show gets places most of time in space. The show has some very good action
                  moments and has good music.
If you aren't careful, you'll miss the puns riddled throughout this lively space odyssey paired with a collection of music that is sure to captivate your auricles. The cast of characters the show focuses on are not unlike vinaigrette. Their personalities and background are unmistakably distinct from each other, but when things get shaken up, their styles blend together and compliment the other nicely, making a sensational taste. Enough with the metaphors and puns already! There's plenty of action to keep you interested until the end. The plot is wonderfully written. And there's even a nice subtle love interest to appeal to both genders. I urge you to watch this artsy collaboration for yourself. Enjoy the artwork but also listen closely to the messages within. Either way, you are bound to like what you are about to see.",9,Charette,

                Cowboy Bebop is not a show for everyone. It's not a plot heavy show, with only about 4 or 5 episodes furthering the story, the rest being episodic. It lacks the high adrenaline levels received when watching a shonen. If this all sounds like stuff you don't like, it might be better for you to spend your time on another show you know you will enjoy. However, if you don't mind all these things you may just find a show that will stay in your head forever. 
Cowboy Bebop is a show about the crew of a spaceship called the Bebop. Each episode they search
                  for bounties in order to receive enough money to scrape by. Although most of these episodes follow their adventures in searching for those bounties, each episode is distinctly unique. This largely due to the Bebop crew. Each character has their individual personality, creating a group with consistently entertaining interactions. The characters never feel boring or dull, yet no character's personality is overshadowed by another. 
It's these characters that elevate the story. Each member of the crew has a past in which they may have attempted to escape from, but is beginning to catch up to them. The beauty of the show comes from the way these plot threads are organically woven into the story. These characters' pasts are a big part of their lives, but they don't dwell on it for too long. Most of the time they're too busy trying to earn money to even think about it. However sometimes unfinished business appears that they cannot delay, allowing different sides of their personalities to show. It's in these moments that the characters, alongside the show, adopt a more serious tone that gives them both an added depth.
There are many other things that make Cowboy Bebop great. The voice acting in the Japanese dub is top-notch, certain moments of the show feature stunning animation, and the soundtrack is amazing. However it's not just one of these elements that make this show the mature and artistic show that it is, it's all of them working together. If you feel like this show is up your ally, you should watch it. It is a show that will stay with you.",10,Abeedo,

                I,ve been hearing a lot about how Cowboy Bebop is so unoriginal and that there are way more better anime out there but they are wrong, there is nothing else to it they are just plain wrong and here's why.
Story 9/10 this part I can understand a little bit because the show has an episodic manner and then it get's into a story at the end and some people say that the rest of the show was a waste but if the show was about the characters trying to get to the end the show would have been much worse everyone says that all the
                  episodes are the same but when I rewatched it I realised that none of the episodes were the same,there was this one user who said that all the episodes were like an example that he gave and he perfectely described 1 episode, none of the other episodes were like that.
10/10 The art is also one of the most outstanding things about the show, all of it was so smooth and interesting and everything was slightly shaded to compliment the tone of the show.
Sound 10/10 The sound and the music are beyond perfect for the show because the hole show is in the future but the nice jazzy guitars and harmonicas make the show set like a western and they go perfect with the show. Not to mention the opening is kick ass.
Characters 10/10 A lot of people say that the characters are cliche and boring but they,re all good, Everyone says that Spike is your average cool guy but why is that bad? You litterally just insulted someone by saying that they,re cool and Spike is more than just cool he is skilled at martiwl arts and he has many funny and cool one liners to make his character loveable. Jet is good but people say that he doesn't have character devellopment but Cowboy Bebop is not about character devellopment, it,s about peopke who have been through character devellopment and they are just living out their lives.
Enjoyment 10/10 The show has many interesting stories anda ridiculous amount of amazing scenes the action is cool the one liners are epice and/or funny and the show never lets you down on any episode.
Overall 10/10 Cowboy Bebop is the best anime of all time and if you don't think so then you have shit taste.",10,Daedalus12,

                I will be honest, I am not all that fond of Cowboy Bebop. I can understand why this anime is hyped as much as it is but with regards to my own personal taste in anime, it’s not that high up on the list. Nothing personal, just not my cup of tea. 
For me the biggest thing is, can I connect or feel some love for any of these characters and in all honesty, I couldn’t. I didn’t necessarily like or hate anyone character. I just felt indifferent. 
These characters are to put it simply, drifters. They don’t necessarily belong anywhere else except all together.
                  The show revolves around their bounties and along the way, pieces of the crewmates personal lives come to light. 
 I was in all honesty disappointed at how things ended with Spike especially concerning the women he loved and his former partner. It felt anti-climatic. Way too fast. You could tell we were getting their but there wasn’t really any development. We got more development on Faye and Jet’s past, in the proper sense than we ever do with Spike. I honestly felt unsatisfied with his character development. 
The plot in general was very interesting. It’s like combing the old West in Space with Jazz and Blues music which you honestly wouldn’t think is a good combo but so is Gintama with space aliens and Meiji era samurai all in one mix. Some of the most surprising combinations go quite well together.
I will have to say one thing, the music was amazing. Personally speaking I’m not really a big fan of this sort of music but I haven’t come across many anime that have such a unique musical style all their own. It’s Cowboy Bebop’s signature.",7,Simplicity1511,

                Cowboy Bebop is one of those anomalies that transcended the norm; it wasn't popular in Japan initially but was a big hit in the Western world, it paid alot of homage towards its' Western influence & it was slightly more realistically mature.
When I say ""realistically mature"", what do I mean? We've had mature themed anime in the past (Macross, Ghost In The Shell, Akira) but Cowboy Bebop was one of the first, to me, that was set grounded in real life. Even with the fancy new toys and futuristic setting, it was essentially a love triangle that has gone wrong.
It was Spike, Vicious, & Julia
                  show and everyone was just tagging along for the ride.
I'm pretty sure most of the points, good or bad, I can discuss have been pointed beforehand, and much more eloquently than I would so I would just like to leave some parting words.
If you like space westerns, space operas, cyberpunk, great action scenes, awesome dogfights or a really mature premise; then this is the anime for you. If not, check it out anyways. :)",10,shonenfanatic,

                As a child, Cowboy Bebop was an animation that ""I didn't get""; it was focusing on a much bigger picture that wasn't tied to explosions and intense action. Now as an adult and rewatching the series. I am convinced that it is one of the greatest animation/shows ever made. There is a mastercraft work of how this show delivers its ideas and characters that we often overlook or take for granted today. The main character Spike Speigel is no superhero or beefed up multi-colored character, but rather a cocky, lazy and sometimes efficient bounty hunter. The brilliance in this setup however is that Spike feels
                  more human and relates more to me than any character in animation I have yet to see. His past and his attitude all reflect a sort of Han Solo anti hero style that makes him compelling to watch. Of course Ein, Edward, Valentine and Jet are also great characters to watch too as their backstories give just enough to wet the palate of your imagination and leaves them open ended for you to decide for yourself what their lives are like.
In a world where anime can take to monstrous heights and commitment where watching hundreds of episodes can be a huge deterrent for newcomers, Cowboy Bebop only comprises of a single season and carries far more impact and power than any I had watch even now. This is not to overshadow other shows that have their own moments, but to see something so short get so much right is why some, myself included, consider it a masterpiece. The opening is iconic and really is one of the best intros to any show (including non-anime) that you could ever have, with jazz and blues mixed and with a touch of this Wild Western grit that really hooks you right in. 
Of course there are always flaws to every show and this one is no exception. While the artwork and design is still strong overall, there are some animations that have seen age and can be a bit silly despite a possible serious tone. Not every episode has the same quality (which all still rank above well done anyways) given so it's a matter of looking far more into the themes and concepts to take more from it. Aside from some nitpicks, the show still remains a staple to animation done at it's peak. 10/10s are often misunderstood by people as ""perfect"" but nothing truly is; it's just a representation of how a craft is fine tuned to deliver compelling pieces of art and characters that we take away from. A gigantic explosion will always be trumped by a finger gun by a dying man as he shows his last cocky attitude to the viewer. 
Cowboy Bebop is outstanding in it's entirety. Nothing is weak or dull for a single episode. The characters and their backgrounds are all wonderfully interesting and have a huge sense of relativity to ourselves. We often see anime show teens that fight for their emerging adulthoods and being as changed people. Cowboy Bebop shows adults that don't change and the struggles of living in such a world that it makes it even far better. Watch this animation, there is a sadness and yet engrossing tale to be told that is outstanding in every sense of the word.",10,BlakDak666,

                ""Once upon a time, in New York City in 1941... at this club open to all comers to play, night after night, at a club named ""Minston's Play House"" in Harlem, they play jazz sessions competing with each other.

They must create new

That quote is probably a valid review of the first 24 episodes of the anime.
Cowboy Bebop is a set of parables, picking up and dropping off at whatever random points the main characters happen to stumble upon them, and in some cases, ending them. The beauty in Cowboy Bebop stands in the one story that we kinda sorta actually get to see. The story of Spike. I would argue that just about every other story told would be just as interesting as his if only we had the time to more fully develop the characters and plot. But Spike's story, that one we do get the pleasure of experiencing. The weight that we get to carry. 
This anime is about a very specific aspect of the human experience: empathy. It forces us to empathize with a roster of characters and watch them struggle. Not at all to the extent that as something like Texhnolyze, but enough to make you ponder the reality of what you've just seen. Every character lives and dies by their own decisions, and you're tasked with burdening those decisions; to understand and accept them. 
Other than that, it's simply an astonishingly good looking, good sounding, mostly episodic, perfect anime with tons of style points.",8,VeiledEdge,

                Amigo! Believe it or not, I've never seen Cowboy Bebop untill now. Let's see what I have missed.
Story:
While there is a plot throughout this anime, it is mostly episodic. That was not what I expected, though I really didn't mind it. After 24 episodes I was sure that the finale could not be all to good, there was just too little build up...but I was wrong. Bebops last two episodes are one of the best endings to an anime I've seen so far. I only wished we could've seen more of the main plot. The standalone episodes mostly delivered, either in a comedic way (most
                  of them) or just as good little stories.
9/10
Art:
Cowboy Bebop was aired in 1998, but the general look feels more like 1988. But unlike many shows of the 80s and early 90s, this one has flawless animation and is generally pleasant to look at. There is very few uses of CGI, but when it's used, it sticks out. I personally don't like that. That's the only real flaw I saw here.
8/10
Sound:
Do I really have to say anything? Even if the voice acting was horrible (it isn't, in fact it's pretty good), the soundtrack is so incredibly good it would still justify 10 points. Jazz, Blues, Country, Pop, Rock, Metal, it has everything and it always fits. I know everybody has their own opinion, but seriously, if you don't like Bebops soundtrack, you are officially deaf.
10/10
Characters:
Spike and Jet are pretty cool guys. I loved watching them, I liked how they thought, talked and acted. Faye on the other hand...let's just say I'm not her biggest fan. I'm not saying she's terrible, but she is not as good a character as the rest of the crew. Ed is an odd case. The thing is, Ed doesn't really add much to the show, except for comedic relief. Usually, those are the characters I like the least. But it is scientifically proven that you can't not like her. The few episodes she had a bigger role in made me want to see more of her. The rest of the cast was somewhere between okay and good. Nobody stood out too much in either direction.
7/10
Enjoyment:
I didn't expect to be blown away by this anime, but it was a very fun ride. I never had to force myself to watch another episode, I actually almost marathoned it (for my watching habits that is). Cowboy Bebop is considered one of the best anime of all time. I don't know if I can agree on that, but I can surely say that it is a very good one. Only thing that would be even better would have been more plot episodes (as stated above).

                I know it's overrated.  I really do.  However while comparing Gandhi to Jesus might be overrating him (don't take this any way as other than an objective example) he's still damn near a perfect 10 in his own right.
As far as story goes, it's amazing.  A little contrived, perhaps regarding some tropes here and there, but god dammit it's executed fantastically.  The wealth of western references and culture elements in the show also give it a very, VERY distinct feel and atmosphere when compared to other anime.  
Art:  FanfreakingTASTIC.  Gorgeously dirty urban environments, this grizzled and heavily stylized
                  and lanky feel and a look that pretty much just screams blues/jazz is one of the best styles of animation I've ever seen.
Sound:  Holy hell the music...  The bluesy guitar and harmonica pieces, the jazz-influenced background music and fight soundtracks and the slow, somber closing piece by Yoko Kanno add up to, in my opinion, one of the greatest and most unique soundtracks ever.  Some might argue that there's some resemblance to Western themed music, and there is, however it's not overly similar to the point of feeling contrived.  Sound effects had a nice '80s movie feel to them, further adding to the atmosphere.
Character:  Amazingly interesting characters, definitely all unforgettable in my opinion.  Even the dog...  Characters were developed and fleshed out very nicely through to the very end.  
Enjoyment:  Sometimes it felt boring, but it was as I was thinking to myself how bored I was that I realized that the characters were also bored, themselves.  It captures the atmosphere of being a badass bounty hunter in a space-western styled world fantastically, and the fight scenes as well as the wealth of comedy made for an excellent and fun experience.
Overall this is a 10.  Yes, it has its shortcomings no doubt, but all in all I'd say it still makes up for them.  I'll defend to the best of my ability my decision in giving it a 10, but if you think it wasn't that great for whatever legitimate reason then that's fine.  I will openly admit that I was utterly sucked in by this anime to the point of no longer being able to view it wholly objectively, thus biasing my opinion.
Still, had that not been the case, I doubt I would've given it lower than an 8.5. It's fantastic, and should be watched by all.",10,Ih8anime17963,

                Cowboy Bebop was supposed to be a “gateway drug” - it was supposed to get people (i.e. young Americans) hooked onto sophisticated and beautiful anime. And it did just that.  
However, what happens when someone gets hooked onto the more classic Japanese anime first and then regresses to watch Cowboy Bebop? Well, for starters, the appreciation for the show is completely redefined. 
First, let’s start with the basics of this show. Its a futuristic show about adventurous bounty hunters with scarred pasts who travel in their spaceship Bebop throughout the solar system capturing criminals. That in and of itself is prime for creating an
                  incredible story. So, our characters Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed, and their dog (forgot his name already) create some sort of melded family that is both entertaining and quite heartening to watch. Their dynamic is the story, and their dynamic is what makes the plot so neat to watch. 
The key feature of the plot is the build of the show. Cowboy Bebop has an intricate 26-episode long spread that are separate but connected episodes. For example, most of the episodes are all individual stories in and of themselves, however they give an overarching theme hooks you on. And the story that has been building throughout the entire show begins to really solidify towards the end. Each character seemingly has their own ongoing stories that converge and develop, most notably our great protagonist’s Spike - but more on that later. 
Second, the build. Since the build of the show is not continuous (one clear running storyline comprised of many episodes), this structure enables this theme of dis-attachment that is so quintessential the show. What do I mean by that? For example, if we take Naruto, many fans get attached to the characters because they closely track their actions over a long period of time and get to see them overcome difficulties that have been going on for years. However, its different with Cowboy Bebop. Given their roles as rogue bounty hunters and space travelers, our characters already tend to not attach themselves to too many things and roam to the melody of their own unbound spirit. This perhaps is the greatest message that the construction of this show portrays in my humble opinion. It’s a sweet reminder to not get stuck in the past and follow whatever wherever your heart points you - to do that which you need to do.  
Other quick notes on the build - the animation is solid. I didn’t feel like I was watching a show from the 90’s because they apparently remastered it in 1080, so honestly it was better than most of the newer anime that I have seen. Refreshing to say the least. 
Next, the characters. This 1998 anime is ‘cult of personality’ and character. Maybe its due to the age of the show and the genuine creative spirit of its producers. I don’t care what, but they nailed it for sure. The characters are all amazing in their own respect.  The character who I obviously have to start with (and the only one I’ll write about) is Spike Spiegel. Since I don’t think my writing can do justice to how well-developed his character is, I am going to keep it short. Spike is for certain people - he’s the solution to both the human conditions of boredom and wanderlust. For those stuck in the same place all the time, Spike embodies the freedom-loving characteristic that inspires adventure and personality. For those lost in the infinity of wanderlust, he exudes a sense of conviction (despite his apparent lack of professional dedication). He, as so many have aptly put, is cool in his uncool. Despite the fact that this is a short 26 episode show, he is undoubtedly one of my favorite characters in anime. But thats the thing: Spike is the kind of character that a creator simply can not maintain in a long anime - he is too much of an ideal as opposed to building a practical and (relatively) simple character like Naruto or Kenshin. 
Interestingly, it isn’t quite old-school, but it isn’t quite futuristic either. Since the show is so focused on characters, it seems that the personality of these characters makes it an easy show to admire throughout the years (no matter how old the show gets). Its timeless.  Cowboy Bebop is the cult of personality and individuality 
The things that I have mentioned so far constitute the core of the cake. But what about the frosting? Music. The final thing that I want to delve into is music. The jazz and hip accompaniments are so quintessential so the show because they maintain a symbiotic relationship with the personality of the core four characters. The music helps complement their personalities, and the character’s personalities are captured by the viewers through the help of the music. Many artists have written tributes to Cowboy Bebop through their music (ie. Saib - one of my favorite hip artists). If you watch the show, I highly recommend listening to the Cowboy Bebop jazz composition playlist on Spotify - if you watch and like this show, you will appreciate this playlist (regardless of your music taste). 
Anyway enough talk. 
We all know that any 1+1+1 does not equal 3. There is a synergy that arises from all the components of this show that put it in an emotional realm that is immune to the rules of math and logic. That is Cowboy Bebop. A solid 10 - nothing less.",10,KingBaloo,
1,"
                I finished Bebop and didn't dislike it. How I would describe Bebop is that the world they have made is one of the most 'lived-in' of all anime that I have watched. You may recognise it's age with it being a late 90's series but the detail, environments, animation are all superb. With the animation, it just goes above the standard you would normally expect. Spike's combat, Ed's unorthodox and springy movements are full of character, really charming stuff. Voice acting is generally great too.
Anyway, I would rather state why I find the anime as a whole to be underwhelming. Yes I went in with
                  higher expectations than normal as it is such a renowned series. Everyone has a story, which is great. These stories are described well to the viewer. This establishes the characters well. However, this is it. I know the characters and I like watching them do their thing but on the other hand, the show only gives so much for me to care about the characters to an extent. I don't prefer Bebop because it is generally ambiguous and favors episodic adventures that don't make me invested as much as an over-arching story would be. I know it isn't really fair as a review but still.
Spike versus Vicious doesn't feel fulfilling. I know why they are going at each other but all of their encounters don't feel powerful or tense. A lot of their encounters are mostly to showcase the brilliant animation and direction, but the impact of these showdowns really doesn't feel profound.
It is great to discover who the cast are and spectate their mischief, all with beautiful art and animation but without proper motivation that could invest my interest further, it is only a seven out of ten.",7,Boooota,

                Stand alone episodes with the right pacing and fluid character development are very re-watchable. I have re-watched Cowboy Bebop dozens of times and it never gets old. It can't. The art is too damn good. The music is too damn good. The character development is fluid though the story isn't serialized. And as far as the story goes, it is outstanding. Based on the characters, each main story segment follows Spike's past. Each of the characters get their episodes to uncover more and more about their pasts. Spike's is definitely the most deep, though you don't get to uncover it all, I think the restraint
                  in telling all about all the characters' pasts is Cowboy Bebop's greatest strength. I've re-watched Cowboy Bebop dozens of times and it never gets old. You can't be disappointed with the quality and you can't but help getting attached to the characters.  Truly the best animated TV show ever.",10,Jizzmasterzero,

                How do you know if you’re cool? If you have to ask then you’re not cool. Cowboy Bebop is cool. Not just  because we all say it is, but it just is. That’s its natural state of being; cool. 
Cowboy Bebop came out at a time when the anime industry was trying to find that next Pokemon, flooding the market with kiddie stuff that alienated those of us from the OVA era. Where’s the adult oriented stuff that made us fall in love with this subgenre? We thought anime was dead. Then comes Cowboy Bebop and faith is restored. 
Cowboy Bebop is the story
                  of everyday life for adults. You work, try and put food on the table, and hope you don’t die in the effort. Some may dislike it for that very reason. Lots of anime focus on the optimism of youth and the potential that it brings. Cowboy Bebop shows the grey drudgery of the daily grind that awaits us after school. It plays with the facets of life’s perspective; 
Faye a woman running to a past she cannot remember, Spike is running from his past to live in the present, Jet abandoned his past though is always comes back to haunt him and Ed lives solely for the moment never once thinking about the future. 
They smoke, they drink, they gamble, they’re all looking for a quick fix to end their financial woes. Sadly, that’s what being an adult is all about. Cowboy Bebop illustrates this with a beauty, style and grace that makes us want to endure it. Never has our bleak future seemed so fun and worthwhile.
Also Yoko Kanno did the score. I was familiar with her work on Macross Plus, my all time favorite anime (this is the best Mac+ is my fav) and source of my all time favorite song. Her touch adds to the sensory experience making you feel the the series as opposed to simply watching it. When I found out she did the soundtrack to Kids On The Slope, I immediately set myself to watch it.
I want to add something personal to this review. Cowboy Bebop came to me at a time in my life when I needed it the most. So I understand people who swear Naruto & Shippuden is the greatest thing ever, if it was that series for them. Despite the fact I want to shake them like a British nanny (cuz its not), I understand them. For me Cowboy Bebop is one of those anime, like comfort food. No  matter bad a day I’m having, I know I’m just one episode of Cowboy Bebop away from making it that much better.
It is in fact the greatest anime ever made.",10,camay1997,

                Back when I was 110 years old, someone had introduced me to this anime while I was just getting into anime, using it as an excuse for my doctors to not cut off my medical insurance, since I now had a reason to live. Anyway, this anime is brilliant from start to finish. Spike Spiegal (the main character) is one of the greatest anime characters ever created, with his amazing back story, and his cool laid back demeanor when it comes to fighting or collecting bounties. He is supported by Jet Black, a former ISSP cop named the ""Black Dog"", or whatever you'd like to
                  call him, Faye Valentine, a 77 year old bounty hunter with a gambling addiction who has a debt that can can make the U.S national debt look like a fucking joke compared to what she's lost, and Edward, a 13 year old computer hacker who hasn't even heard of the use of socks and shoes in her or his or (fuck even the dad doesn't know the sex) lifetime. 
The story in this series is superb. A few episodes focuses on Spike's past with the Red Dragon Syndicate and his rival Vicious, and girlfriend Julia. Each of these episodes leads up the epic conclusion of the series, which to this day is considered one of the best anime endings of all time. There are also episodes that focus on the other supporting casts, such as their backstorys or involvement with major issues related to the plot. 
The soundtrack is also superb (screw you I like using superb) with music that beats the crap out of 90 percent of anime today. Just listening to the opening them ""Tank"" reminds me of the good times I had with my ex-wife back in the Jazz age, until she jumped off a bridge when I realized she was stealing money from my bank account. But anyways, if you haven't listened to it or have, you should definantly go buy it, since it's worth evey penny of your useless life.
The animation is also outstanding, with it's lighting and visual backgrounds, such as downtown environments on different planets struck by the poverty bug. It is made to look more realistic and eye popping than my birthday records.
Overall I would reccommend this to anyone, a current anime watcher who hasn't seen it, or a newbie into the anime community.",10,TheDrmcvey,

                What is it about this show that makes it a classic? That makes it a must watch? Is it the refreshingly humanistic, genuine and semi-realistic characters? Or maybe its the jazz and blues infused atmosphere that Watanabe so masterfully pieced together? Perhaps it’s that ending that paradoxically leaves us beyond satisfied but with a hole in our heart? What do I know? I’m just a pretentious nerd with way too much time on my hands.

----------------
Now I was 2 when this anime finished airing so I can’t really compare it to all the anime that came out in the late 90s (Other than Mobile Suit Fighter
                  G Gundam and Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, which imo it looked a lot better than both of those series) because even though I’ve watched quite a bit of anime I’m not too sure when most of them originally aired. The art style like most of Watanabe’s works is always different than the norm, most of the character designs are pretty original in my opinion specifically the main characters and one of the only anime characters who comes to mind that resembles Spike is Mugen, but Samurai Champloo was also directed by Watanabe and follows a very similar style as Cowboy Bebop. Since Cowboy Bebop is following a bounty hunter in space he visits a variety of different planets which usually look distinctly different so you won’t be bored by the background.  When I went through the whole series of Cowboy Bebop I never felt the animation was lacking in any of the action scenes and even though yes it’s been about 16 years since Bebop was finished so animation wise you can’t expect it to stand up to most recent projects with their crazy budgets and new technology. Even when I watched Bebop a couple years ago I felt that it looked a bit more dated but in a good way, I feel that the art style being a bit darker and not very flashy portrayed the blues and jazz vibes Watanabe was trying to give off.
Sound
--------
Alright in my personal opinion Bebop’s got one of the greatest soundtracks to date. I’ve been jamming out to Tank for over 5 years on my phone and it really never gets old. But honestly if you aren’t a fan of blues and jazz you might not like it (I’m not even a big fan of blues and jazz but Bebop is the shit), but throughout the show you’ll probably agree that the majority of the OST is very fitting and maybe even has replay value. BUT WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT THE OST WHEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE VOICE ACTING. Now I’ve never heard the Japanese version but the English dub was just too fucking good. Not gonna lie either, I mainly attest this to Steven Blum who did the best performance of his career voicing Spike. Blum’s got one cool ass voice and it’s way too fitting for such a cool ass character like Spike. One negative for me though was Ed’s voice I guess, and it just annoyed the shit out of me from time to time that’s all.
Story
-----------
It’s a space western – Hence the name Cowboy Bebop.  The Cowboy in the title is interpreted to be Spike since he’s a bounty hunter in space and to hunt these bounties he pretty much always needs to be on the move. Then there’s the Bebop part of the title which is literally the ship that Spike and his fellow bounty hunter Jet travel from planet to planet. It pretty much follows an episodic format with each new episode or each new couple of episodes following one of their bounties and usually I feel episodic series just aren’t my thing. But even still I don’t remember any episodes that felt slow or dragged on and this show does eventually let you know that in this episodic space exploration bounty hunting fun there is an underlying linear plot line to boot. I think one of the aspects of this show that separates’ it from other series is the extremely well done execution of our main characters past. Their pasts are like a puzzle and every once in a while a piece of that puzzle is put into place until in the end when we’ve got that finished puzzle.

Hot damn man, can you really be an active user of this website and not heard of Spike Spiegel already. One of my favorite youtube reviews *cough cough* Gigguk *cough cough* put him at the top of his most epically cool character list. In terms of anime I’d say Spike pretty much has got the Rule of cool d own. He’s a very human main character and shit constantly won’t go his way. His two weapons of choice are his hand-to-hand combat style that mirrors the way Bruce Lee used to fight and his sidearm pistol. I’m not going to try to argue that the main cast has a shit tons of depth but they are damn well entertaining and interesting characters and even though you can classify them as clichés well almost everything is a cliché nowadays. So I don’t think the main cast was really lacking anything but I definitely though the main antagonist was, he was as one dimensional as villains get and I was never too interested in him because all he did was make me think “Why are you fucking doing this? This is almost entirely pointless man” because even though we get some backstory on him that doesn’t really leave him with an underlying motivation for being Spike’s primary antagonist. So what I think Cowboy Bebop is lacking is a well thought out main antagonist that can be more than one dimensional.
Overall: 9/10
---------------
Whenever I think of classics in regards to anime I think Cowboy Bebop, honestly it’s the first thing that comes to mind for me. I’ve always recommended this series to any newcomers to anime because I almost feel that after finishing Cowboy Bebop you’ve finished a rite of passage. It’s not without flaws, I definitely agree but I don’t believe that those flaws weighed it down very heavily at all. So in the end I give Cowboy Bebop a 9/10 overall rating and just want to let you know that I find it damn well one of the most entertaining and enjoyable series I’ve ever watched.

                I try to stay away from a score of 10 as it sounds untrue as nothing is perfect but I must say after watching this.. though this review comes late it has been the closest show to making it. The story was very good at keeping you interested it did lack a backbone and you never tricked yourself into believing that the characters were in much trouble, up until the end that is and boy do I love that ending. the art is absolutely gorgeous I believe it was one of the last animes to be drawn by hand and it shows. the music I
                  quite enjoy but if you don't like blues you might not enjoy it as much. the characters are somewhat average though I'm told it was quite new for its time and even though it is somewhat normal now they play their characters well.

                To begin , Everyone enjoyed this anime theres no question about that however you will always see mixed recommendations well because its been aired on adult swim over and over again. What i mean by that is and im one of those people , when an anime becomes so main stream , so flushed all over the place i tend to hate on it just because people who don't really watch anime will defend to the grave.
Now , Im not going to even talk about the anime because im not good at hiding spoilers but it is for sure a 10/10 when it originally came
                  out. It has one of the best soundtracks of any anime , really nice art style , and probably the only acceptable anime to be dubbed.

                Story:
In the year 2071, much of the world has transferred to different planets and space crafts. Our two main characters: Spike and Jet, are bounty hunters, tracking down bounties and delivering the targets to the police to make money.
Cowboy Bebop is a collection of stories with a arcing story throughout the whole series.
Most of the stories are very well written and very dark and intense. What might put off some viewers is how slow the episodes are. Some episodes drag for little bit too long. But this recovered for the most part with episodes that are action packed and really fun.
Rating: 9Art:
The art in Cowboy Bebop is very stylistic and gritty. The characters designs are very unique, and each character looks very different.
The whole style is also very reminiscent of noir movies from the 40s and 50s. The noir theme really gives the show its own identity.
Rating: 10
Sound:
The soundtrack for the anime is fantastic. The show uses jazz very effectively to add to the atmosphere. The opening theme ""Tank"" is one of the most iconic anime themes ever and for good reason, its catchy and lets you know what you are getting into.
Cowboy Bebop features one of the best dubs ever made. At many times its better the Japanese dub. The voices match perfectly to characters.
Rating: 10
Character:
The characters in Cowboy Bebop make the show really fun to watch. The characters are:
Spike, the closest character we have to a main character. He has an dark past and wants to run away from it. He has a fun personality with quick dialogue. Definitely one of the best characters.
Jet, he's the captain of the Bebop and is an ex-police officer. He has a fake arm and legs. He's very stern but also very quick and clever. He has very good dialogue with Spike and is great because of it.
Faye, coming in at episode 3, throughout the whole series Faye is probably the one who grows the most. She is cocky and mean. But really is a good person. It's always fun seeing how she is going to get out of a situation.
Edward, coming in at episode 9, Edward is 13 year old girl, who is a computer hacker and loud mouth. She is quite annoying in some cases, yet fine in others. She's a very mixed bag and feels a little out of place.
Rating: 8
Overall Rating and Enjoyment:
Cowboy Bebop is a classic, and a anime that nobody should miss. That said it isn't perfect and has many problems. My enjoyment went up and down as the series went on. But the ending is one of the best anime endings and I did feel satisfied when it ended.

                Well first of all the most memorable thing about 'cowboy bebop' was the opening song witch was just epic. Considering that it was released in 1998 it is a really great anime. Interesting characters with various ideas and past. It didn't take too long to watch since the plot is interesting yet simple. Also why it was interesting to watch is because the main characters weren't over power considering other side characters and everything didn't just go their way. It was funny serious and had action and when everything combines it is just a great creation. The music selected for different scenes were selected perfectly
                  in my opinion.",10,OzoR,

                Even in the future, you can't outrun your past. This is the best anime ever created. Sure it's funny and loaded with fantastic action sequences, but you can say that about many series. This stands well above the rest because the story arc is rich and nuanced, with many-layered characters fully inhabiting an interesting and well-developed universe. There is greater depth, sophistication, and development in this ad hoc family of wounded loners (Spike, Jet and Faye) than there is most live-action work, never mind animation. Hell, the supporting cast is populated with characters with more history and complexity than the leads in some series. Complex
                  relationships, affections, and allegiances unfold over 26 episodes, and there is a beautiful symmetry in the construction as the characters individual stories are unpacked like nested dolls. The artwork is dark, distinctive, and evocative. It is not always as smooth in some respects as some contemporary animation, but given the obsessive attention to detail the creators demonstrated I believe this is a conscious choice. No element of the production is haphazard; each element is part of an integrated whole. Even the stand-alone episodes which could be seen as irrelevant to the overall plot are ultimately connected (Consider the ghost story Toys in the Attic, which, when examined, revolves around an old decision by Spike which comes back to threaten him and everyone around him, and which he must face alone). The sound-track is a genre-bending tour de force by Yoko Kano and holds its own as an OST box-set. The English dub is among the best and loses nothing over the Japanese. The series is haunting, bittersweet, and rewarding. Episodes 25 and 26 comprise the most powerful hour of animation ever. Period. Some people might not like the genre, or might not dig the story, but you can't deny the exceptional quality here. No serious anime fan can ignore Bebop.",9,jyagan0,

It has a good premise, an uncommon one so it makes it more interesting. The story when it has fun, it really has fun, and when it gets sad, it really gets sad. I was close to shedding a tear towards the end but I was overcame by a feeling of hollowness, which is much worse. I got closure from the end, but I don't think I'm satisfied with it. I'm really gonna miss this one.

Hands down one of the best openings I've ever seen. It's not textbook, it's creative, it presents characters in an unorthodox way,
                  it transitions in an unorthodox way, it's an opening I wouldn't mind watching through over and over again. Animation is top quality, and the fights are just a joy to watch. Same goes for all of Watanabe's works. As for character design, I absolutely love it, I've never seen such different characters. Every character is distinct from one another, and it makes the anime so much more memorable. Not to mention, the animation. The animation is superb, especially for an anime of its time. The fight scenes are so clear and smooth, so entertaining.

""I think it's to time blow this thing, get everything stuffed together. OK, 3-2-1, let's jam!"" I love the soundtrack for this entire anime, it has the right songs to fit in the right moods and it helps to evoke so much more.

Spike is an interesting one. That being said, all of the characters are interesting. Including the supporting characters that only last an episode or two. They have all have an interesting background and personality that makes them so much more memorable.

I LOVE THIS ANIME. I love Samurai Champloo as well. I've always been a fan of Watanbe's work. He has a story that just hits it on the nail that keeps you wanting for more yet helps you understand that there can't be more. Perhaps if I were to critique anything about the anime, is that it's only so long. It feels like it can go on forever, but at the same time I feel as if 26 episodes is enough. Nevertheless, it's an anime I can say blows out any anime of its genre out of the water, including the newest ones.

ABSOLUTE must watch. I don't care if you don't watch action anime. Cowboy Bebop is an ABSOLUTE must watch. It's undeniably good, and a definite classic.",10,Nigwin,

                I'm kind of partisan here. This has been one of my favorites for a very long time. While many of my other favorite series have been replaced over time, this one still easily fits in my top 5.
Approaching 15 years since first broadcast, Bebop's art still rivals the best of current productions. Fully CG backgrounds, when used, are largely well integrated into the show's artistry. To be fair, of course, there are a few places where you can see the infancy of the medium when comparing it to Shingeki no Kyojin or Psycho Pass, but you have to be looking to find it. The CG
                  never detracts from the story.
Of course, what truly brings Cowboy Bebop together is its music. Yoko Kanno's instrumentation are superb - and they fit so seamlessly into the story you feel almost as if the scenes were designed for the music rather than the usual music designed for scenes. A Jazz fan myself, I couldn't be happier with the score, though you needn't have studied Jazz to enjoy the music.
At heart, this is a character driven show, but don't let that fool you into thinking there isn't an overarching story. Some episodes are more obviously connected with the backbone, while others only lightly touch upon it. Yet every episode contributes to a story that truly deserves its place among the masterpieces of anime, and indeed of all cinema.
Those who haven't seen it yet, or who stopped within a few episodes wondering what the hype is about, I suggest you ride the show out. While I can't say you'll think the same way I do by the end, I'm confident you'll understand how compelling the story is by the time you finish. Some shows don't deserve the hype they get. Cowboy Bebop proves, even at 15 years old, that not all hype is undeserved.",10,leonov246,

                When I read a synopsis for ""Cowboy Bebop"" learning that it was about bounty hunters wandering in space in hunger and desperation, looking for criminals to regain money, I pictured something a little inane.
Cowboy Bebop is actually a luxurious little comedy-drama masterpiece about the pain of being poor and out-of-luck, especially for an adult who considers his life to be a nightmare or a dream that he can never wake up from. Spike is not only a troublemaker, he's tired, hungry and feeling a bit hopeless for money. An ex-cop (in which he considers his partner) reintroduces him to new characters, a gambler, a hyperactive
                  genius smart aleck and a super-intelligent dog as they attempt to help collect criminals for money to make his life easier. Not to mention, he cares for him and even his new friends a lot.
Anime featuring characters jumping into the anime every few episodes take a lot of money to produce and usually work if the build-up depending on the synopsis is correct. Anime these days usually introduces us to new characters maybe once in a few episodes but usually around the first episodes. Well, here, it's done tastefully and emotionally. It's really good to see Ein, the dog come first as the new character in the series in which everyone seems to like, Faye, a selfish woman who is sometimes criticized and sometimes praised, for liking the character, Spike Spiegel. And then there's Edward, she comes in a while in which everyone describes as cute and fun or sometimes thinks that she could be annoying sometimes.
Towards the end of the series, I started bawling my eyes out because some of the characters start having more and more problems depending on their lives and they must face it... it's gone. Anime about the anime are usually a little coy, but ""Cowboy Bebop"" is an exception. With its film-noir characters, it understands the bounty hunting or desperation world and is quite wise about poor or ghetto people live off-screen.

                “And the work which has become a genre unto itself shall be called… Cowboy Bebop”
This is one of the quotes you’ll be seeing during the eye catches of the show and it’s not far off from reality. Cowboy Bebop is an anime that mixes many genres to make one entertaining journey. Episodic in format, this anime contains many different story of many different lives while uncovering the main cast’s back story slowly. The show starts off with a glimpse of the Spike’s past, the anime’s lead. With a dark, mysterious opening, then to a fun, jazz-heavy theme, it won’t take long for someone to realize
                  that this anime isn’t just one genre. From action-adventure, to mystery-drama, this anime hits on all of the genre without feeling weak on any sides. A classic to many, a masterpiece to some, this is Cowboy Bebop.
~{Story}~
Due to Cowboy Bebop being episodic, it doesn’t have its main story being continued one episode after the other. Instead, the main story is broken up into pieces, with smaller story arcs fill up the gaps. Normally I don’t like episodic shows unless they’re slice of life anime, but this show manages to present its story in a way were it seems a non-episodic format might have ruined it. The premise is a group of bounty hunters (Spike and Jet, then Faye and Edward being introduced later in the show) who try to capture bounties in order to, well, live. Almost each episode has their own story and you’ll notice very quickly how each episode has its own taste to it; each episode feels different from one another. Some will get you pumped up, others may make you teary. What Cowboy Bebop does so well is making sure these tiny stories don’t make the entire anime messy or unorganized. It manages to present each story it has to offer without making it feel disjointed. The main story however is simple but it’s just so well presented that you enjoy the story more than you do. Mentioning the main story in the review is spoilers because it takes place well in the anime. It’ll take a handful of episodes to know what the main story is. Let’s just say, it has something to do with Spike’s past, which you get a glimpse of in the first seconds of the anime. Just don’t expect the main story to be shown consecutively, as it is interrupted by many other, smaller stories. And as many said before, it’s not about the destination, but rather the journey.
Story: 9.5/10
~{Presentation}~
It was the one of the most westernized anime of its time for sure. Not many anime can properly be westernized without looking like a mess or without have a small audience. However Cowboy Bebop manages to have a westernized feel to it which helped it to get an audience outside of Japan, without losing Japan’s audience. Cowboy Bebop’s look to it is what helped anime become more popular in North America and Europe, therefore Bebop has achieved so much, and influenced so many thing is both Western culture and Japan’s too. Many anime tried to copy the westernized feel of Bebop, but fail to be as good as what it’s influenced by. Also, Bebop is one of the most stylish anime I have ever seen. The style is composed of many factors, such as it balancing many genres, its westernized and more modern feel, and it music-heavy presentation. Music isn’t just used in its, well, music, but in other things too such as the names of the episodes are called sessions and each name is some reference to music. Cowboy Bebop also has a very consistent pacing. It’s never too fast, nor slow. Each episode, being in an episodic format, flows perfectly from one another, even though they don’t connect from one another. The reason so is because each episode starts at a slow pace, build up to higher note, then slowly brings the pace down then ends its episode. The fact that each episode doesn’t end it a fast pace helps create a flow as the next episode needs to start in a slow pace in order to build up a different story. But in the end, all I can say is that the presentation cannot be compared to any anime because of how unique it is.
Presentation: 10/10
~{Character}~
The main cast consists of four people: Spike (the cool, chill bounty hunter who’s past comes back to him), Jet (the ex-cop now bounty hunter who is the most level headed of the bunch), Faye (the attractive, yet deadly bounty hunter who isn’t the most brightest), and Ed (the wacky little girl who is an expert hacker). Each character is so distinctively unique from one another, yet they together make the perfect combination. Each character is so well done, you just don’t notice it until the end. You start off with knowing nothing about these characters, yet you enjoy watching them. And as you progress through the anime, you learn more and more about these characters, you start understand they’re feeling, not matter how much they try to hide it. Each character has their own past and they are so well done. Even Ed’s backstory makes sense. These stories they hide makes them so real and convincing. They are by far the best cast of characters I have ever seen. Even the supporting characters are well fleshed out, even if most of them have only one episode to develop. When an episode makes you cry you’ll be wondering how a character that you’ve only met for minutes, made you so emotional so quickly. When the climax hits and you know about the characters more, the outcome just feels heavier.
Character: 10/10
~{Art}~
Since Cowboy Bebop takes place many years in the future, the world that is presented in this anime is much bleaker than you would expect from a future-heavy sci-fi. Crime rates are way too high, poverty in every corner, this is a future that is convincingly real and possible. The show’s art is very detailed as every detail is visible to everything, and objects far away have enough detail to not find it distracting. This anime has many details to objects that don’t need any, such as liquor bottles have labels that are sometimes readable. The show really shows the contrast between vivid colors and muddy, gloomy colors and use those colors to describe situations. The best example would be when Spike goes to Mars. Where the rich live, building are clean and the art’s glossiness helps show that and the lush green grass represents the life in the area. But other sections in Mars, such as where construction is still taking place, or ghost towns, darker, moodier colors are used to represent the area. The show doesn’t need words to represent situations as the art takes care of that. The details in the art makes me feel why can’t others do the same? Anime these days tends to take shortcuts but making background objects less detailed and not use the art to explain situation. Cowboy Bebop was way ahead of its time back then, and sadly it sometimes seems as if it’s ahead of time today too.
Art: 10/10
~{Animation}~
Most of the anime is hand drawn except for a few areas. The parts that were computer animated were rotating objects in space, as to make them move smoothly, CG would be more helpful. But everything is hand-drawn and the effort is clearly visible. During fight sequences, for example the one at the end of the first episode, you will notice how fluid and crisp the animation is. When Spike gave a while sliding off a table, that’s when it hit me; it’s too fluid for its time. I’m not a 90’s kid, but I know how animation was back then. Never have I seen hand-drawn animation be so fluid from that time. But the animation has a style to. The cinematography is very impressive. The anime sometimes uses a top view to show the landscape of the area, and it works really well. And there are so many tiny details in the show to. Some anime are too lazy to animate the backgrounds, but Bebop puts in all they got. Some of the animations in backgrounds are subtle, yet noticeable. In today’s standard this may seem normal, but for 1998, it’s quite a lot. Even animations for character lip-syncing is much more impressive than anime today. 
Animation: 10/10
~{Voice Acting}~
The Japanese voice cast is filled well-known artists. Kōichi Yamadera as Spike is fantastic, as he portrays coolness in Spike and emotions in him when necessary. Unshō Ishizuka as Jet is great, as he able to probably portray strength and matureness with his voice acting capabilities, but is also able to portray weakness too. Megumi Hayashibara as Faye is superb as she can do the fragile side and the weak side of Faye properly. Aoi Tada, who didn’t have much experience before Bebop, was able to capture the wackiness of Ed flawlessly. But this is one of the fewer anime where I found the English voice acting better than the Japanese voice acting, mainly because of Spike. Steve Blum as Spike is beyond words. Not only is he able to portray coolness to a next level, but his also able to add charm too. Not to mention, some of Spike’s lines sound way cooler in English. Beau Billingslea’s Jet isn’t as convincing as Ishizuka’s, but it’s still good enough. Billingslea’s lacked the emotions Ishizuka portrayed. Wendee Lee’s Faye was much more convincing than Hayashibara’s as she was able to sound more powerful and weaker than the original Japanese voice acting. Melissa Fahn’s Ed is on par with Tada’s although I did like the fact that Tada’s voice acting made it seem confusing at first what gender Ed really is. The supporting cast’s voice acting is fantastic, both Japanese and English.
Voice Acting: 10/10
~{Music}~
What Yoko Kanno created with Cowboy Bebop is beyond words; this has to be the greatest OST ever created for any media ever. The OP, “Tank!”, is outstanding. The perfect blending of jazz is just the best thing to hear and it really sets the tone of the show; it lets you know that a journey is ahead. The ED, “The Real Folk Blues”, is fantastic too. There are two other EDs, one being “Space Lion” (at Episode 13), and “Blue” (at Episode 26). In my opinion, these two EDs are way better than “The Real Folk Blues”, and they sound even better in the anime while you’re experiencing what is happening in the situation. Many other tracks, such as “Rush”, “Spokey Dokey”, “Rain”, “Words That We Couldn’t Say”, “Call Me Call Me”, are just some of the many tracks that makes Cowboy Bebop so special. With nearly 10 hours of OST, it’s obvious that there was a lot of effort put into the music. And many of the tracks were either not used or used very minimally. Many songs have been used of for the eye-catches, for example “Fantaisie Sign” is one of my favorite tracks from the OST, but was only used during the eye-catches of the anime. Another great thing about this anime is that besides the OP and ED, no track is repeated twice, not even for the eye-catches. Some people make a mistake thinking “The Real Folk Blues” was used for the final moments of the anime, but it was actually “See You Space Cowboy”, which used the same music, just the lyrics are different. With each track being used not more than once, there is no repetitiveness in the music. No matter how much you hate Bebop, you must love the soundtrack… unless you hate Jazz, or good music.
Music: 10/10
~{Enjoyment}~
With many different genres in this anime, there is something for everyone. Not everyone will love every episode because some may not come from their preferred genre, but there’s always some episodes that instantly become your favorite because it’s your type of episode. Once you finish the anime, you’ll feel like watch some episodes again, the ones that were your favorite. Also, due to the anime being episodic, it’s easy to just pick a random episode and watch it (once you’re done the anime that is), without losing the experience. Whenever I don’t have anything to do, I just select one of my favorite Bebop episode and watch it. If you want a lighthearted moment, or you want to fiddle around with your emotions, you know what episodes to watch. A little bit of action, watch this episode. A little bit of drama, watch that episode. There are many pop culture references in Cowboy Bebop, both Japanese and Western, so that’s a little extra for more enjoyment. Also, if you really enjoy the soundtrack, you can listen to it whenever you’re doing something, and maybe get addicted to it like I still am.
Enjoyment: 10/10
With all those 10s I’ve given, it doesn’t mean it’s a perfect anime, because nothing is really. It’s just that this the closest an anime can get to perfect. There are one or two hiccups in road, but nothing big enough to stop the ride. An anime I watched seven times (three times in Japanese, four in English), it still doesn’t get old. With it having a heavy influence of introducing anime in western culture, it surely is a classic, and a masterpiece.

                The other day I finished Attack on Titan, and now I finished Cowboy Bebop... two amazing anime, drawn quite differently, yet both powerful in its own way. You want to see an anime that's highly mature, characterized, even philosophical? One of the rare gems whose English dub is perhaps superior to the sub? This is only the second I've seen dubbed, after Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. You want to see a troubled character, and wonder yourself about your purpose in life? Existentialism. Loneliness. The power of silence.
Cowboy Bebop is episodic -- that is, most of the episodes have their own short stories. But that's to be
                  expected, given the nature of the characters. You can criticize Bebop all you want for this, but hey, an anime's setting and characters produce the plot. Bleach, for example. You could say that it's extremely elongated and contains too much combat, but as practically all of the main characters are fighters (whether Shinigami or not) and Soul Society is protected by squads of fighters, and they fight Hollows and other variations, combat just has to run the show. Bleach can't be as character-focused as Clannad or plot-developed as FMAB. Cowboy Bebop is about bounty hunters, and you can't have a series about just finding one or two bad guys. If you want to reveal more about the bounty hunter life and delve more deeply into the futuristic world, then having the crew go after multiple bounties is just natural. So if you're thrown off by that, I can't blame you, but nevertheless you must try it out. Like Attack on Titan, Bebop performs magnificently with progressive revelation, but this time into the characters' pasts. One of the (many) superb facets of anime is the hidden past of a character. Here the pasts continue to haunt the characters, especially Spike Spiegel, the protagonist. As you watch more and more of Bebop, you see more and more of the main characters' pasts and empathize more with them.
As I mentioned before, loneliness. Spike is such an awesome character. I mean, I've seen some pretty awesome characters -- Natsu Dragneel, Ichigo Kurosaki, Tomoya Okazaki, Toshiro Hitsugaya, Lelouch, Light Yagami, etc. But Spike just beats them all. Besides his skill in hand-to-hand combat and outwitting his enemies, he is someone so influenced by the past. Take the impact of Simba's past from The Lion King and put it on steroids. Simba had the whole ""you can't change the past"" thing, right? Exactly what happens with Spike. Why is he so nonchalant? Why does he go towards danger so rashly? Not because he's cool (well, that too), but because he has already died to him. I won't explain more, perhaps I've said too much already. He is such a complex person. The character development -- or rather, revelation -- of Spike Spiegel alone gives the characterization in Bebop a 10.
The art of Bebop is from 1998, so it's quite different from anything more recent. But I think the older styles are better in that they can show more depth, more hue to the setting and characters. The way cigar smoke billows into the air. How flashbacks are tinged with a sad grey. Whenever Spike fights. If Bebop were animated by, say, Bones after the style of FMAB, it would be different. After seeing Bebop, I am more motivated to continue watching Neon Genesis Evangelion, to see more of that art style.
The opening by The Seatbelts has panache, elan, style. The ending is sorrowful, grey, morose. Take the two of them together and you have the character of Spike -- outwardly easygoing and jaunty, but inwardly conflicted. The soundtrack is jazz, and can range into all the necessary emotions. Heck, the music of Cowboy Bebop has its own Wikipedia page.
The only reason why I gave Enjoyment a 9 out of 10 is because while I enjoyed each episode, I was not captivated the whole time, that is, I did not rush to finish the show in one run. This is one of those shows that you enjoy more as you watch, and after you finish and come to realize the awesomeness of the series. Up to the last episode, the strings are all pulled together and there is a resolution. It's one of those endings that you may not think you want, but it's the ending necessary for the story.

                the story:
the plot of this anime doesn't begin to unfold until the very end of the anime. most of the episodes include missions unrelated to the bigger plot, and that is my biggest problem with the anime. 
art:
the art used in this anime is very intricate, yet familiar for the viewer,  since the story is set in a time period not distant from today, we get a feeling of what the future potentially will look like. 
sound: 
love the sound of exploding gun powder. also, the background soundtrack fits perfectly with the anime. 
characters:
the character design for this anime is simply genius; each and
                  every character is unique in their own way. i've never seen a character as original as spike spiegel, or edward ( the computer genius; and shes a girl ). it makes the story much more interesting. 
enjoyment: 
this is one of the more meaningful animes that i have seen. it leaves the viewer to not only think about the plot, but just life in general. 
&quot; i felt like i was watching a dream i could never wake up from. before i  knew it, the dream was over.&quot; - spike spiegel
overall: 
the main reason why i give it a 9 overall is that the episodes involving the unrelated missions don't exactly correspond to the main plot; all those episodes could be taken out and the viewer would still be able to understand what was going on. however, this anime has had a good deal of impact on the way i watch animes. this anime portrays a great deal of symbolism, in which the viewer is also left to ponder and translate the puzzling philosophies of spike spiegel.",9,hansis,

                I know what your thinking a six for Cowboy Beebop how could you? Well I'm sorry, but it was just a six out of ten anime for me. I don't think it was a waste of my time but I didn't really like it either. The characters are good and interesting but they don't really interact, they don't really change all that much and they don't get satisfying ends to their character arcs. Some of the episodes are certainly interesting, but a lot of them are pretty dry, and the lack of an overarching plot thread and the lack of progress between episodes means that
                  it can get pretty boring and repetitive. 
Spike's mysterious backstory never really becomes interesting and neither does his rival whose name and appearance make him seem far to much like a character who doesn't realize he's in the wrong anime, which makes it really hard to take the rivalry seriously. It doesn't help that his rival has a personality almost as mysterious as his backstory, and yet were supposed to take his and Spike's rivalry very seriously. 
The opening is of course amazing and the fights are very well animated. As I said it wasn't bad but when someone was talking about how good it was and asked me to back them up, I simply found myself going wellll. It's a 6/10 for me.",6,D0g0n2,

                Cowboy Bepop
Unique show that  features amazing characters amidst a fun episodic style.
Episodes are either (background) stories of the main characters or episodic stories about new characters.
Those episodic episodes manage to fully flush out one or more characters in only 20 minutes.
The story episodes are also amazing , the backstory for the characters is very well made and it makes you better understand their personality and overall character.
This show simply has everything and commits practically zero flaws along the way.
The animation still looks good even after all these years and the English voice acting is some of the best around.
In the end this show delivers
                  an amazing journey with good characters while never feeling tiresome or repetitive.

                I've heard a lot of people call Cowboy Bebop the gateway drug for anime. After watching it I agree 100%. It was the first anime I watched and it introduced me to this wonderful world and I can't thank it enough. Everything about Bebop is perfect. I can't say that for any other anime even if I love it. Nothing about it should change it's perfect as it is and anyone who likes movies or cartoons, doesn't have to be anime, would absolutely love this show. 
The story is perfectly wrapped in some episodic instances. The ratio between them is ideal.
It has a beggining and
                  an ending and everything in between.
The art is old-school but it's honestly some of the best art I've seen.
Sounds and music are insanely good. I listen to Cowboy Bebop soundtracks in my daily life.
Characters develop perfectly with the story it all works.
Enjoymnet I think you can guess was insane.

                Story:7
the story of cowboy bebop is not the main focus of this show as it is an episodic show. If your here for the story there will be some really good stories, most prominently Spike Spiegel's backstory is phenomenal but unfortunately only lasts about 3 episodes. Other than that most of the show is just a fun ride so if you're looking for a really story driven show this is not for you.
Art:7
The art for cowboy bebop is really good and if not for my distaste of old looking shows the art would be an 8. The show was made in the 90s so the
                  aesthetic will be a big part of this show so it really depends on your taste but other than that the show's drawings looks good and serves its purpose
 and has slick animation even after decades it still stands the test of time.  
Sound:10
The soundtrack of cowboy bebop is perfect. The opening is extremely phenomenal and is extremely catchy. Cowboy bebop's soundtrack to summarize is the type of soundtrack I would listen to outside of the anime.
Characters:10
The characters are made for the show. Spike is the more serious chill type guy, Jet is just serious, Faye is the cute melancholic type character and Edward is the comedy relief (and a good one at that) all made for a fun show.
Enjoyment: 8
The show is just a fun ride that I believe every anime fan should watch.

cowboy bebop is one of the fun anime ride and will probably stick with you the longer you watch it and rewatch. Cowboy Bebop defined a genre and I will always regard it as a classic fun anime.",9,semen_fighter,

                i'm a tad bit conflicted heading into this review, that's because this is an anime that's one of the of the most popular ones in the west, and what does that mean exactly? praised as if it was bigger than art by numerous professionals strictly connected to media, it has a swarm of fans that will skin you alive if you try as much as to criticize it.
make no mistake, cowboy bebop is a good series but it is lacking to be a masterpiece. and a 7 is a good enough score for it, i believe.
there is no real plot in the 26 episodes series
                  that is cowboy bebop, the amount of it is enough to fill up at least half a season, the rest is just dragging it out with multiple scenarios that hold absolutely no correlation with the already small amount of plot and that some 'could' call 'plotline' and the some utterly unnecessary characters. some episodes were easily 10s with how both entertaining and interesting they were but most of them don't go higher than a 5. and the 'most' in this case are episodes that were just pointless.
why did actual crucial characters like vicious and julia have little to no appearances or additional plot? why did the series add in some characters that nobody cares about and that weren't crucial to plot or characters and their development? the ending was, you could say, satisfying for an ending at least but it feels like i've been going full circle this whole time while i was trying to reach the climax of the show.
objectively, i held this show before and still do hold it in high regard. cowboy bebop is a well-made show and it's definitely worth a watch and what it does excel in is the compelling cast of (main) characters, art for its time (which is good) and the music but my subjective view on it is what will bring masses to tell me how my taste is shit for bringing out the flaws on their favorite anime.
i wanted a series that would tackle the main characters' pasts (especially spike's) and the characters themselves more than it already did, more from julia and vicious in general, well that was not exactly the case here. good show, not good enough to be a masterpiece.",7,psyart,
1,"
                Cowboy Bebop is considered a masterpiece of an anime nowadays, and it was one of the first anime recommended to me when I started getting into anime. I was excited to get into the series, but that excitement unfortunately did not last. About halfway through the series, I had to keep forcing myself to watch another episode just so I could finish the series (I don't like stopping in the middle of a show), but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's just start with the story.
There is no story. This is an episodic series, which isn't a problem in its own right, but isn't something
                  I'm typically into. I prefer overarching plots that tell one cohesive story. However, I have enjoyed episodic series before, so I kept watching. I quickly got bored of the repetitive plots. The villains of each episode were hardly interesting because they didn't get enough time to do anything. That really goes for all the characters except for the core 4. There is never enough time to develop anything enough to the point where I actually care. The individual stories are fine on their own, but they just felt like a drag to get through together. I'll give a 6/10 since I did enjoy a good number of them, but the ones that I didn't just felt like a chore to sit and watch through.
I'm putting art and sound together because they are both fantastic, and it's hard to talk about one without the other. The animation is consistently fast and fluid, and the directing is amazing. The music almost always goes perfectly with each scene its in, and the OP of the whole series is one of the most catchy openings I've listened to. The dub of this series is also great, with each voice actor doing an amazing job for their respective characters. Both get a 9.
Now onto my main complaint, the characters. The core four characters, Spike, Jet, Faye and Edward are all very well developed, and I enjoyed watching them (except for Ed, she got annoying fast). The problems come with everyone else. As I've already said, none of them get the time they need for me to actually care about them. They have to establish the characters, and then, in the same episode, wrap up their stories, and that just isn't enough time. Spike, Jet and Faye were all great and well developed characters, but they are the only ones who I cared about in the entire series, so 4/10.
My enjoyment level for this series continued to go down with each episode. It felt like a chore to watch another episode, which is why it took me four months to finish this series. It did have some really great moments, and the action in the series was consistently very good. I can definitely see why this show got its cult status, it just wasn't for me. I'll give this another 4 for enjoyment, and overall I'd give it a 7/10.",7,Nyrotike,

                 I my eyes cowboy bebop is an classic..it can never be replaced by an anime trying to come up with the same concept. it was cool for me because it didn't just try to have one main character (besides you always seeing spike) it had told backgrounds of the whole crew with is good. every episode has some kind of gun acting with was great for kids cause we love violence and i just loved how spike had that laid back character it just hooked me ever since the first episode. and how could you not enjoy tank (the opening song even if it
                  was jazz i enjoyed it? Plus ""the real folks blues"" was even better than tank it left me feeling good at nigh when i watched cowboy bebop",9,kingdomhearts,

                Finally saw this after pretty much every one of my anime-watching friends recommended it to me, so I had some seriously high expectations of this series when I started.   Thank goodness I wasn't disappointed.
The story: 10/10
Bebop is nothing like your average anime, it's run rather like a Saturday morning cartoon.  It features less of a cohesive connective plot and is more like a play by play capture.  The story not cheesy though by any means: each episode usually has the characters in some situation, usually involving a bounty, and will shape up into anything from a goofy but awesome action packed
                  shootout to an emotional look into a character's past.  Overall I felt like they got the pacing really well.  And without spoiling anything I can still say you want to watch until the very end because it's pretty emotionally impacting compared to the rest of the usually lighthearted and carefree tone throughout the story.
The art: 8/10
This is the 90s we are talking about, so despite the limitations of 20 year old tech the show still looks pretty good and moves fluidly at most points.  The age does show in some of the detail and the show's take on what is ""advanced"" technology could be better, but the detail and care put into the action scenes was pretty awesome considering there was practically no computer imaging.
The music: 10/10
The jazz soundtrack composed by Yoko Kanno and Seatbelts was half of why I loved this series.  A great mix between lively horns and upbeat tempo for the action scenes and slow almost smokey saxophone for the more somber times.  I would definitely listen to this outside of the show.  
The characters: 9/10
The cast for Bebop is weird and therefore each is memorable in their own way.  The show took time to make each of them relatable by diving into their back-story at some point, and everyone plays an important part of each episode.  I've  never seen a cast that is so well balanced overall, but I  arrived at the end honestly wishing that I knew more about them than I did.  The series makes you look in like an outsider, but I felt like it intended you to feel that way.
Overall I loved this show for being so different.  It doesn't fit any anime ""formula"" and it's not perfect (because no anime is really), but it is one of a kind and invokes a kind of nostalgia that I couldn't explain.  If you don't mind branching out and seeing something that dares to be really different you will  likely love this show as much as I did.",10,LordFabio,

                Story
Cowboy Bebop is a great gate way anime. The story is very episodic with different scenarios for almost every episode other than the main plot. The story is easy to grasp, so you don't have to watch multiple times to get the gist of it. The story tackles themes of existentialism, identity, and loneliness very well. 
Art
Animation is very slick and stylish. 
Sound
The soundtrack is the best part of the series. There are many memorable tracks including the ending theme "" The Real Folk Blues"" which I consider the best ending theme to any anime ever. It is very verstaile for the easy going to
                  the serious episodes. Autumn in the Gandyme, Call me, See you space cowboy, walk in the rain, and blue are also great
Character
The characters are well developed and we learn more about them as the story moves along. They are not super likeable and I commend the creators for creating interesting flawed characters. Ultimately I consider this more of a Character driven show than a story driven show.
Enjoyment
Well developed entertaining ""flawed"" characters and excellent jazzy music make for a wonderful and memorable watching experience. The pinnacle of ""cool"" anime.
Overall
The show can be best summarized as a stylish mix of film noir, space western, and martial arts movies to the backdrop of jazz and blues. Easily one of my favorites, but I do not believe it will have massive mainstream appeal. I would recommened it for sure though",10,Awoo4U,

                Cowboy Bebop is an anime that seems to feel different depending on what period of your life you're watching it in. 
I remember watching this when I was barely in high school, and thought it was just ""meh, 6/10"". I didn't resonate with the characters, the art style and music wasn't my cup of tea, the plot was near nonexistent, but I loved spaceships and the action was pretty decent. 
Fast forward to my mid/early 20's and I gave it a rewatch. At this point in my life, I'm still trying to figure myself out as a person, who I am, what I want to
                  do with my life, and so forth. Now, I understand Mai a bit more. She's trying to figure out who she is, what she wants out of life, and just winging it as she goes. I care less about art style now and learned to appreciate the amazing upbeat and jazzy soundtrack that the anime gets its name from.
As an adult, going out to the real world after college, I began to be more aware of my surroundings. It's here that I noticed the world building, each episode giving a glimpse into what the Bebop universe is like. I started to appreciate the slow character development of the 4 main characters as well. I burned through each episode, wanting to know more about their past, their motivations, and how they got to where they currently are. 
In my early 30's, I felt vulnerable after a breakup, but learning to accept my emotions and who I am as a person. I gave Cowboy Bebop another watch, something to take me away from this world, something to remind me of better times.
I never really like episodic type shows, but for Cowboy Bebop, I don't mind it. I didn't have to commit to watching more than one episode per sitting so I can take my time, yet there's enough story and character development to pull me into the next episode if I want. Every character is nuanced and has a past that you want to know more and more as each episode melts into the next. The world building really stood out now as the show completely pulls me into their universe, making me regret being born too early to be a space cowboy.
The character development is more impactful as well. Rather than having young characters that grow and change into better versions of themselves, we have characters who have already experienced the weariness of life. You see glimpses of their past through flashbacks, but not too much as to obstruct the main story. This didn't appeal to my younger self, but now I completely feel for them and their experiences. Whether it's Mai, who's trying to find her way through life, Spike, who's got a dark past he's trying to escape, or Jet, the father figure with a broken heart, they all have some sort of past that defines who they are, yet not hold them stagnant. Life moves on, and they know it. They have to face their past, sooner or later. The way the show builds up to these moments are very well done. 
Every time I watch Cowboy Bebop, I notice something new, I appreciate something different about it, and I gain a little bit more perspective on myself and life. Maybe in 10 years, when I watch it again, I'll appreciate something different about this.",9,OnceAndAgain,

                There's not much left to say about Cowboy Bebop anymore. Smarter people than I have waxed wonderful things about the series. I'm a sucker for cool, and Cowboy Bebop oozes cool. It's cool without sacrificing humanity; there are moments within this series (particularly during the last quarter) that are as emotionally taut as anything you'll find in anime. The individual arcs mirror the jazz theme that kicks off each episode: Scattered, seemingly rushed and incomplete. It's when you abandon your need for A to B to C storytelling that Cowboy Bebop's beauty shines. (I wouldn't go so far as to say you need some jazz
                  background to enjoy Bebop, but I would also so that I liked Bebop on a rewatch much more after I had a jazz obsession phase.)",10,TheTheory,

                Cowboy Bebop is the kind of anime that you like the minute it starts, with that marvelous soundtrack/opening. The narrative is about some adventures of a group of bounty hunters in the future in space, where they fight and laugh, live together and trust each others (in their own way), and in each episode you got something new. Yes it's something kinda ""old"" (1988), and there are some fans who can dislike the graphics, but in my opinion it's something very cool and I strongly suggest this one to all of members who didn't had the time or the desire to watch it.

Cowboy beebop is an anime that has a notorious soundtrack and excellent camera manipulation, the direction is really extraordinary!
The anime genre is very different from the usual and it's super interesting to see how ""the pieces"" fit together.
I also can't forget to mention the great script, the great characters and also the great sense of humor.
The references that the anime uses are diverse, we have references to Bruce Lee, the band ""Queen"" and in one episode they use the Tchaikovski soundtrack, ""Waltz of flowers"" which is a super famous classic song!

these are all thing i heard about this anime but it really turned out to be just an over-hyped garbage, i have never been so disappointed, it really had the potential to be a masterpiece
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS
There are so many things wrong in this anime from story telling perspective and character development perspective
The biggest mistake is that this anime is an episodic anime, it really shouldn't have been that way
the reason being there is no overall plot, in the irrelevant episodes nothing adds to the story
let me make it more clear
In the anime ""Violet Evergarden"" the overall plot is learning about human emotion and in the last episode Violet is finally able to feel emotion so the anime being episodic makes sense, or 
in the anime ""Monster"" it's about finding the root of evil so all those experiences the protagonist goes through will impact The decision the hero has to take so it's okay for it to be episodic
But in Cowboy bebop there is no overall plot, the last  episode had nothing to do with the previous episodes, and the big problem is the confrontation between vicious and spike, it could have been 10000 times better, we know nothing about the villain, all we know is that spike was in a war with him a long time ago and we learn that with 2 second flashback that he has!
this is so awful, the villain is literally apparent through the entire series for about 5 minute!
who the  hell is he? why Faye was so scared of him? why everyone keep saying he is colder than ice? we NEVER see anything from him to believe he is the cruelest of them all
There is also a problem with character development and characters themselves, who in the world thought making a retarded kid whose legs and hands move randomly a main character, is a good idea? i can not stand that fucking kid, the most annoying character i've ever seen, i hope she suffers in that desert
the next badly written character is Julia; the girl, the woman spike couldn't stop thinking about, the angelic demon, the demonic angel, surely we get to know about her personalit... don't waste your breath she only appears for about 5 minute
and i hate the opening song, it's probably the worst op i have ever listened to
In overall 20 minute of this anime is good and that 20 minute is good only because of the soundtrack!
just watch episode 5 and 26, those are the only good episodes",4,AgentBishop,

                   Let's start off with a false dichotomy, the show in question is often criticized for its preference of style over substance, a complaint that demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of art and is as insubstantial as it is hypocritical. On the other hand Bebop is praised endlessly for its technical aspects relating to presentation (animation, sfx, voice acting, etc), often coupled with some sort of attribution of a more profound message about these sort of vague, vacuous, mostly unreal emotions and hang-ups; a general lack of will to ""move on"" or an inability to ""be an adult"", to ""grow up"", and other assorted
                  unimportant cliches to be found among all the stylish action and dialogue.
   Let it be said that Cowboy Bebop is not necessarily particularly original, but it never strikes you as trying to be. Essentially, the reason you should watch this, if you have any interest, is that it's cool, it excites the eyes and ears, and is not without its own flavor of emotional engagement. Bebop has prodigiously choreographed furious flights of fists and feet, charmingly cheesy dialogue, if you've got the right disposition for it, an entertaining, resonating cast that despite the pulp-like world they inhabit, feel realistic and believable, arguably more references and homages than it ought to, and a mostly pleasing soundtrack that at its best properly surprises when it matters to back it all up.
   Despite whatever previous intentions one may be unaware of, Cowboy Bebop isn't really about anything other than being around for the ride these characters are on, a dramatic spectacle of a trip to be sure. By the end of it you're left with a strong feeling of shared experience, which should be expected of any character driven piece of fiction, but Bebop excels at this, which is probably why it stuck with so many people for as long as it did.",10,Kotinos,

                This is one of the few anime series that I give a 10 across the board to. Every episode is unique and mesmerizing. Every character has a purpose. Every fight scene is artistically done. Most of all it has one of the most interesting concepts of any anime I have ever scene. Anime aside, it's one of the best sci-fi series of all time.
This series is about a small ship of outcasts that travel around space and to different planets just trying to scrape up a living. They're usually flat broke and a little desperate. Typically their work makes them bounty hunters, but for the
                  most part they're all space cowboys that will take just about any job they can get. They have a strong sense of right and wrong, but revenge is never out of the question.
If you like westerns and space dramas then this is for you. If you don't, well, then this is for you anyway. I've never talked to anyone that didn't like Cowboy Bebop. This is a must see.",10,explicit707,

                 Do you know that hunger pang when you haven't planned on anything to eat it, and you check what food stuff you have and randomly put things together; and it tastes great ( most likely because u are really hungry). Well that's the kind of feeling I got when I was watching Cowboy Bebop. I mean cowboys or bounty hunters to be exact, syndicates, space gates and a lot of other, um, stuff all in 26 episodes is really peculiar and familiar all at the same time. 
As a person who is accustomed to long running shounen anime, I found Cowboy Bebop quite refreshing.
                  The show comprised series  short, not-so-interconnected  stories. After watching the first episodes, I thought a story line would pick up; I was wrong,however. Nonetheless, the short stories were enjoyable. Each episodes has this strong emotional scenes which a person can really feel exuding from the anime. I am talking about such things as betrayal friendship,love and the like of sort . What I am trying to say is the story does not over-exaggerate events relating to something sentimental compared to anime now. You would understand when you watch it. 
Art
 I am not really a good judge of art, but the one in this anime is shouting an 18+  rating. 
Characters
Since this is a short anime. You are not likely to get emotionally  involved with the characters. Spike, the main character doesn't speak much: Jet is always scolding them off: Faye just wants to hug all the bounty to herself: Ed is just eccentric though I will say he - or is it a she- is my favorite character.
  I started watching these show because it had high ratings, and I read a lot of posts about it saying how classical it was, and how it didn't participate in fan services. Frankly, I don't know the definition of classical anime, but this anime is worth given a shot. Through Cowboy Bebop episodes, my favorite was episode #24 , I really felt something there.",8,abdul23,

                Well, I started watching Cowboy Bebop because it had the same Writer and Director as Samurai Champloo. and since I really enjoyed that one, I decided to try this too.
Until episode 7-8 I thought Champloo was better and the characters were cooler. but than, I decided to stop comparing the 2 series and watch this one as a total different one. It was around the time that Ed got into the anime. boy, I love that character :D I found the trick quite helpful and I really enjoyed Cowboy Bebop. It had comedy, It had Drama, It had romance, It had mystery,... It was near
                  perfect! 
And the ending...WOW! I really can't put in in words! 
In overall, a very good Anime.",8,Azar,

                Through the reborn industry of bounty hunting in the midst of a future humanity spread thin across the solar system, Cowboy Bebop deftly explores the effects of societal divergence, the interplay of various life philosophies, how feeling like an 'outsider' underpins us all - regardless of how our personalities may differ, and the all-singing existential question: what is reality for me and for you?
These are far from simple themes to discuss for any show, yet Cowboy Bebop does so with a degree of nuance I find at odds with the oft-heavy-handed approach to storytelling and theme building in anime. Indeed, these thematic explorations are facilitated
                  by what is often levied as a criticism to the show. Owing to Cowboy Bebop's primarily episodic nature (character introductions and the like notwithstanding), there can come a feeling of fragmentation and thus no overall flow; however, this is what I perceive to be the show's biggest asset. We are treated to twenty-six 'sessions' - musical motifs run strong throughout - and each of these explores one of the main characters, their backstories, and ultimately how they've become the way they are in the present day to an extent I feel a linear narrative would not have done so as succinctly. The three key characters - Spike, Jet and Faye - have some kind of past life they are trying to either come to terms with or escape from, and the series really does a great job at analysing them as individuals and as a collective party of nomadic bounty hunters in a disparate universe. The rich characterisation really enables you to grow attached to them and compels you to see where they take you - something which is actually quite a tall order considering the anime is only twenty-six episodes long, and all characters have relatively equal weighting in the show.
Of course, the intricate thematic exploration is but one strength to Cowboy Bebop, but isn't necessarily a hook per se. Where the anime also excels is in its production. Shinichiro Watanabe's world-building is fascinatingly stylish and well-realised; every town, city, set piece throughout the series feels as though it belongs there, whilst providing the audience with a real sense of the state of the societies that have promulgated since the planetary colonising took place. Additionally, the crisp, fluid animation really adds to the immersion whilst the soundtrack - composed by Yoko Kanno - covers the jazz and blues spectrum, with both staccato and flowing, sombre and up-tempo pieces that all conspire to provide a truly compelling audiovisual experience that does not feel at odds to the tones of the show. 
Every time someone has asked me for an anime recommendation, Cowboy Bebop has always been first on my list. I feel that this is a masterpiece, a pillar of anime that, by marrying nuanced thematic discussions, engaging characters, quality production and world-building, transcends boundaries and allows people who wouldn't consider themselves anime fans as much as those who would to enjoy - perhaps even love - the series.",10,esoteric_cat,

                Cowboy Bebop is a good choice for you if you're looking for some well animated action series, where you don't have to follow along on an overarching plot, and prefer to kick back to some episodic stories. If you dislike episodic structures, note that Cowboy Bebop does develop its characters, but very slowly, and has continuity in its universe, but its structure relies on building any story it wants with the cast for the most part, while defining the traits of who those characters are. It doesn't promise you anything for the next episode it will deliver. And note that if you dislike when a
                  series isn't particularly colorful, Cowboy Bebop's animation might not come off as well animated, since it's an old anime and stuff didn't use to be very colorful back then.
You see, modern day  anime rely a lot on being colored puddles of puke, where they assort everything with plenty of colors, but without paying particular attention to how it contrasts with everything, and how the viewer will notice the particular details presented in it. It is easy to sell and hook someone with something that is easy on the eye to simply become eyecandy. However, both the cinematography and animation here is what shines, with the series making good use of lightning and camera angles to create really interesting shots and engaging fights. It also paid attention to the motion of the characters, and to certain small details that give the animation life, such as the trembling of someone who is holding a gun in their hands when nervous, as an example. But what I appreciate most about it is the fact that it knows exactly how much detail to put into each shot, as it didn't have the technology or budget to simply build gargantuous images. Rather, it knew how to animate exactly what we'd be paying attention to. Rather than constantly pay attention to the landscape and constantly create beautiful scenery nobody will really focus on, it chooses on focusing on the details that are relevant to the movement of the characters, like the lightning of the shadows, the way things break upon impact and other such little details that make each action scene be more engaging. In other words, it has a great sense in what is relevant to present in a scene, over what would make it look more pretty and it focuses on substance rather than appeal.
The structure of the anime was episodic, mostly focusing on delivering action romps, while developing certain details about the world and its space setting. It did focus on the characters occasionally, but it mostly relied on being capable of using their default state to create some episodic action setpieces. While it is indeed episodic I do want to compliment Cowboy Bebop that it follows an episodic structure that I'd deem respectable. It doesn't promise you it will get somewhere necesarily, as it doesn't have a clear defined end goal for an overarching plot and that's good, because you won't feel like the episode you are watching is a mere waste of time due to the fact it does not progress the plot. But it also has continuity with the characters undergoing some events that give them motivations, but in a way that doesn't break their intended roles, so they can used as a formula. So not everything is gonna be constant and could go through some slight changes at any time which can hook the viewer, but it will never have the risk to break familiarity. It doesn't lie about what it tries to deliver unlike some anime that present you an overarching plot, while taking a lot of side trips that only artificially progress to the end goal of the plot. Cowboy Bebop merely tries to entertain, and that's it. As far as you can expect from it, expect anything, but with the only constant being action and/or suspense that get solved under 20 minutes.
How it tries to entertain is simply by delivering some good looking action scenes in an interesting setting. Personally, the setting kinda took away a bit of my enjoyment, merely because the understanding of space that we had when Cowboy Bebop was produced, as well as certain tropes that existed then, is far different to that of the current day. As an example, someone got worried about some explosives flying in space and said it would be a great threat to travelers, but how would explosives ignite in a place with no oxygen, like space. So when you watch Cowboy Bebop, you have to twist your view of scifi a little bit, as the futuristic setting imagined is far different to our preset one now. Things such us not expecting to colonize planets such as Mars and Venus, that happened in Cowboy Bebop, which are uninhabitable planet, might sound to you as a little far fetched with no explanations. The novelty of the setting is absent, but it is charming in the way of ""so that's how people thought this was gonna turn out"" kind of way. And the setting itself doesn't really take away from either the drama or the action pieces presented in the episodes.
Personally, I consider Cowboy Bebop to be one of the best possible results out of old fashioned anime. In terms of detail, it tries to liven its world up by bringing up small details in the movement and good cinematography, which give it great artistic value. Maybe you won't get something incredibly colorful or as detailed as something that can be animated today, but it is animated in a way that the key elements someone would focus on shine through. In terms of writing, it creates any story it wants at any point, while also being capable of progressing its characters forward. It knows what ground rules to set and how to leave them open ended enough to be potentially interesting for a larger group of people, which is how something commercially viable was aimed back then, rather than subgroups. But it does so in a manner that does not seem like pandering to the masses, because of the fact that it is diversified enough. And I think they did the best with the setting they've created as they possibly could've done at the time it was created. Frankly, I think it is at its maximum potential of what it strived to be, and that is what I found most appealing upon rewatching. That all the criticisms I could deliver are merely due to its age, from mentality of the characters, to animation and the way it was delivered. 
Now that doesn't mean any concerns about it are unvalidated. It is episodic so you won't follow through on a sound story with a beginning, middle and an end, but rather, a bunch of adventures meant to entertain. Some people prefer to see the bigger picture for entertain value, rather than focus on tangents, and in Bebop, while there may not be such things as tangents, there's no such thing as a bigger picture either. Some people might not enjoy something merely due to the fact that it contains action and suspense, so those details can get lost on you quite easily and Cowboy Bebop immediately losing its value. And the setting itself hasn't aged as well as other things in science fiction, and if you can't watch it from the perspective of novelty, or accept some of its shortcomings because it was novelty at the time, the setting won't hold much value. But I personally can't help but respect Bebop and consider it good. It tried its best to be as innovative as it could, while also trying to appeal to everyone by following a structure that will allow change but a lot of constants in it as well and the animation was done in a manner that the shortcomings of the era don't really take away from it, outside of a few dated animation techniques that won't hold today and don't really get used much.
Cowboy Bebop is one of the best things that could've aired in the late 90's. But is it one of the best things that you could watch today? That's the question you should answer yourself, when deciding to watch Cowboy Bebop. I strongly recommend watching Bebop from an artistical sense, if you're a fan of good animation or anime in general, to see what's the highest potential an animated series of that age could achieve in that department. But whether or not you will be entertained by it, strictly depends on you, as the value of it can vary from episode to episode, and its setting is dated enough for you to create your own inconsistencies. Frankly, the question is as simple as this: Do you generally enjoy short selfconcluded action stories?",7,ItIsIDio,

                *This review may include minor spoilers*
Cowboy Bebop. I was pretty late to the party in watching this series but my my was it completely worth it. Cowboy Bebop is not your run of the mill westernised anime about space ships and guns. It is something much more. Let's find out why. 
The story is set in 2071, when the Earth has become polluted beyond repair and the Human Race has colonized most of the Solar System. 
The story begins with our protagonist Spike Spiegel, who's a bounty hunter,  subtly looking for his bounty on Mars like its just another day at the job. What's
                  interesting is the fact that nothing very significant happens in the first episode. Yet, it manages to convey things in such an impeccable fashion that I was simply blown away by it. The fight choreography was top notch, the animation/art style was fluid and captivating and the writing was nothing short of astounding. It is one of those series' which take you into a completely different world when you're watching it but at the same time, there's this feeling of familiarity.
Sound: 
Of course, I couldn't possibly call it a fair review if I don't talk about how amazing the sound is. The music choice is great. It is able to encapsulate the vibes of the scenes in an unparalleled fashion. 
The OP and ED were also really good.
The series continues in an episodic fashion in which the two members of the Bebop(Spike and his teammate Jet) get acquainted with more people along the way, for the better or worse. Most of the series just comprises the Bebop going on adventures and chasing their bounties. But as we witness this story with them, we learn about the characters that there's much more to them than meets the eye. You can't help get attached to the characters as the story progresses. 
This is a series which gave me chills by the end of every episode. Legitimate chills. It is very thought provoking and the finale was nothing less than a masterpiece. I recommend watching this series without a second thought as it has a little bit of something for everyone.",10,badgerino,

                “You told me once to forget the past, cause it doesn’t matter, but you’re the one still tied to the past, Spike.”-- Faye Valentine
This one dialogue perfectly encapsulates everything that Cowboy Bebop is. It’s a struggle between trying to break the shackles of the past yet the more you walk forward the more you realize that you are just falling deeper into the pit of your own past because despite your better judgement, you are what your past defines you to be. Sometimes we can break this paradox and free ourselves from the past but most of us are just stuck on this endless loop
                  of the regrets of our earlier days.
Cowboy Bebop is set in a futuristic western setting that is clearly inspired by Western pop-culture. This is very evident from the homage that Bebop pays to the likes of Sergio Leone’s classic The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and the Bruce Lee inspired fight choreography in the very first episode. We follow the journey of two space bounty hunters, Spike and Jet. They try to catch criminals in space and earn reward for their hardwork. After awhile they get two more crews, Faye and Edward. Faye is a sexy yet problematic woman who is always on debt due to her rather unusual spending and Edward is a young computer genius. Their crew is also joined by Pembroke Welsh Corgi named Ein. Since Cowboy Bebop is an episodic show it predictably has a repeating formula. They do a mission, cause a lot of commotion and damage and once they go to collect their bounty they realize that the cost of the damage outweighs their bounty prize. So, basically they return to square one.
This is why I don’t like episodic shows yet Bebop despite it’s repeating formula stands out. This is because these repeated acts are not due to the writer’s inability to have creative assertion but they explore each character and their belief with great subtlety and care. A beautiful example of this is showcased on the very first episode. Both Spike and Jet witnesses a tragic end between two lovers but despite this, they both move on with the weight of this tragedy on their shoulder not holding them back. They have seen enough to know how cruel the world is and they know not to form any connection to people when everyone is trying to better one another. This is where the beautiful tragedy of Cowboy Bebop begins. Since this is a spoiler free review I won’t point out the specifics but watch Spike and Jet’s behavior towards the end of Episode 24. An ingenious reversal of how they were able to break free of that weight when they were not attached and how human attachment suddenly changes everything.
What truly separates Cowboy Bebop from every other show of this similar style is it’s characters. Each character is beautifully well designed with unique attributes to remember them. The back and forth between Bebop’s crew is one of the shows outer charm but what lies inside is the intrigue of their past and the decisions that made them who they are today. Unlike most stories, they don’t dump their story in one episode and be done with it. No, they carefully weave their characteristics with every episode. They gives us bits and pieces and even before their eventual reveal, we already know them enough to know how their past shaped them and how they shaped their past.  By the end, everything beautifully falls into place as these characters chooses their path when they are standing at the crossroads of letting the sleep of your past drag you deeper into your dream or to wake up.
It’s mesmerizing to witness these characters finally reaching their own resolve with their broken past and chose their own redemption. Some make the right choice and some don’t but this is how life is.
Cowboy Bebop essentially has everything. It has the perfect start that sets up the preceding events beautifully, it has the perfect story midpoint in Jupiter Jazz Part 1&2 and it has one of the finest ending of the medium in The Real Folk Blues Part 1&2. On top of all that, it has what is highly regarded as one of the greatest episode in all of anime and what I consider to be my personal favorite episode in anime, Episode 5, Ballad of Fallen Angels. This episode introduces us to the show’s main antagonist, Vicious. It’s a perfect mixture of intrigue and high octane action that sets both Spike and Vicious on a path that they left unburied all those years ago. I have probably seen this episode atleast 50 times yet I can’t grow tired of watching it.
Cowboy Bebop doesn’t only let it’s narrative define it but it also lets it’s production define it as well. It is easily one of the most well directed tv show to be ever aired. Each episode is filled with magnificent scene composition that lets it’s perfect color shading and detailed background to flourish. One can not believe that this is actually the debut work of Shinichiro Watanabe who went on to make more great shows but none quite as definitive in it’s brilliance as Cowboy Bebop. It is often said that an artist’s first art is what defines them and Watanabe lets Cowboy Bebop’s sheer genius in story telling define and shape his legacy.
Now it can’t be a Cowboy Bebop review without talking about it’s brilliant musical score by the musical genius Yoko Kanno. The musical score of Cowboy bebop is just as important to it’s impressive legacy as it’s narrative brilliance. Yoko Kanno and her band Seatbelts created what is arguably the greatest musical score for a Television show. Each episode is blessed with fantastic tracks that compliments the amazing scene composition of Shinichiro Watanabe. The music mostly focuses on jazz but there is no lack of diversity throughout the soundtrack. The opening, Tank is one of the most recognizable and beloved anime opening ever. The ending track, The Real Folk Blues is a perfect mixture of melancholia and jazz that sets the mood of the show.  Some stand out tracks includes Call Me Call Me, Elm, Space Lion. Every episode of Cowboy Bebop is named after either a famous song or a musical reference.
Now since this is an episodic anime, some episodes are bound to be better than the other ones and some will be weaker compared to the show’s peak. There are no outright bad episode in Cowboy Bebop and even it’s weaker episodes can easily claim to be better than most other anime’s peak points. The particular episodes I am not quite a big fan of are ""Toys in the Attic"" and ""Boogie Woogie Feng Shui"". They are by no means bad, it’s just that they are not as good as some of the other episodes.
Cowboy Bebop is a show which wears a mask. The mask is the fun action-packed show with cool dialogues with distinctive western style but what lies underneath the mask is the cruel truth of how we have to carry the weight of our past and move forward, not let that weight slow us down. You can try all you want to not be attached to your regrets but in the end it’s our past that defines us. Some people choose to walk away yet the others let their past sink them until their present reality becomes an extension of their past regrets.",10,Thatevafag,

                Spike and Jet are just a couple of guys cruising around in a spaceship, the Bebop, hunting for bounties in the 21st century. Though life isn't bad, it wouldn't hurt to have some beef with their beef and bell peppers. Things change though as new characters join the crew and we catch glimpses into their pasts. With the introduction of Ein, a very special dog, Faye, a gambler without a memory, and Edward, an eccentric, computer-hacking girl, bounties become only part of the story. Crime mobs, old loves, and the search for family guide the show to a dramatic conclusion.
Cowboy Bebop is often hailed as
                  one of the greatest series of our time and one which transformed the way anime was done. To an extent, the consensus is right. Bebop went to a new level of dedication and detail, possessing animation and a soundtrack which rivaled those of full-fledged animation films.
Characters and settings are lifelike, beautiful, and hold up against the newest animation being done today. Yoko Kanno presents what is easily one of the greatest original soundtracks to an anime of all time: that a band, the Seatbelts, was brought together specifically for the show and that they successfully captured the spirit of the beat and jazz movements only goes to illustrate the amount of effort put into the Bebop project (noteworthy tracks include Space Lion, Piano Black, Tank!, and Green Bird). But as much as the animation and audio are spectacular, the storyline is lacking. Bebop has potential, don't get me wrong, and was at times incredibly exciting. The underlying premise is unique and should certainly be enough to catch anyone's attention for a good 4 or 5 episodes. The problem lies in a lack of coherency and plot development. While it isn't unusual for anime to have filler episodes which help develop characters without developing the story in any meaningful way, Bebop makes a habit of it.
And while even that may not be a huge problem, the story ultimately has to rely on the premise and characters alone. Viewers that continue to watch will do so not for any sort of developing plot, but because they enjoy the characters, the idea of flying around in space hunting bounties, or the incredible soundtrack and impressive animation. This point was driven home for me while viewing the final episodes: seemingly out of the blue, Spike is infiltrating a crime mob, shooting everything in sight while dramatic music blares in the background. All of this is exciting, but it felt contrived; when there is little to no build-up to the finale, it isn't as good as it should have been. Bebop also brags at times about being a show which will define anime (or a new type of anime) with its creation. Like I mentioned, to an extent that's true. Attention to animation and a superb soundtrack make this an excellent show, and the underlying premise and characters are intriguing and enjoyable. But I would be disappointed in the state of anime were this to become the actual benchmark: the storyline and plot development just don't cut it.

                First of all, I'd like to say that this is my first review and I started doing this in my instagram but thought it would be better to share my reviews in MAL. Also Cowboy Bepop gave me the idea to start writing reviews because I coudnt keep my feedback watching it to myself. So it has this special thing.
  Cowboy Bepop, what should I say.. Let's begin objectively. I had a selfmade synopsis written but I removed it so let's get past it : the episodes' pattern is simple (One bounty per episode), however it's everything but boring. The variety of events makes
                  it impossible to predict what will happen, but that's not the best about it... The most wellmade and precious thing about CB will be for me how they kept each character backstory and mysteries and how they kept showing bit by bit what is really going on in each Bepop member's life, to the extend it's like getting addicted to these moments, until you get the real deal. The way and the scenes they did that for are too good if we take in consideration the settings, the music matching and the sequence of events makes this anime in the edge of perfection, that's why it has this mythical ""Classic"" armor, which is a carte blanche used to defend against any sort of critism by the fanbase.
In overall, big masterpiece, intresting and original characters, very good animation for 90s, even if it has this dull colouring aspect by moments but it's like vintage, and very smooth fights/mouvements display, outstanding soundtrack, with a lot of genres (Jazz, Funk, Blues...), also good soundeffects. All in all, very intense 26 episodes to savor either for anime, or just art, lovers.

                In order to truly appreciate Bebop, you need to be able to do two things:
Recognize just how absurd it is. It's the story of a kung-fu bounty hunter, his ex-cop friend, a shrewd woman with a hazy past and a crazy little girl who happens to be a hacker. Don't even think it stops there; these guys fly through the galaxy rounding up criminals for a quick buck and smoking cigarettes and complaining while looking cool, all set to an unmistakable and eclectic soundtrack featuring many great American styles of music.
The second thing you need to do embrace the absurdity, as well as the sheer

                Wow. I don't think there's a show that has completely won me over after an initial bad impression like this show did. When I started the first couple of episodes, I enjoyed them for the most part but didn't really get the appeal, and as the series went on, I started questioning why it is so highly regarded as it is. There was no perceivable overarching plot that invested you in the story and to me there didn't seem to be any interesting character development. By about the midway point I started questioning whether I would actually finish it. But since I have sort of
                  an obsessive nature that doesn't allow me to stop in the midway point of nearly anything, I continued to forge ahead. I don't know if I just wasn't picking up on stuff in the first half of the show, but I liked the second half of the show way more. More of the episodes have interlinking themes and ideas and many of them take on a slightly darker, more serious tone that works really well. They also build off of the first half of the show really well. Each character, even Ed, is able to dig into their past and we're able to understand each of them more as characters.
Here I want to talk about each of the four main characters individually, starting of with Spike. I found it really interesting and cool that even though he's pretty much the main character of the show, he doesn't take up too much screen time. They way his backstory is revealed feels a little rushed since it's mostly revealed at the end of the show, hurting the emotional impact its implications have on the events that take place in the show. That's more a problem with the pacing of the show though. This goes for every character. The character development is very slow and you gradually learn a little bit more about them each episode. The show is a extremely slow burn in that sense, allowing the events the characters' experience tell you about them rather than exposition. At first I didn't really like that aspect, but it works wonders for the second half of the show. A large reason of why I liked the second half so much was because of how the more nuanced approach to the characters impacted how you understood them. Spike's arc is very bittersweet, but more bitter than sweet. Without spoiling anything, I have to say I was not expecting the ending of the show. You really do ""carry that weight"" after the ending. Jet is a pretty static character for the most part. We do get some glimpses into his past life, but as a character he doesn't really change much. I really loved Faye's growth as a character. The show got really interesting once it got to exploring her past and how she would deal with it. The way the show conveys her inner struggle about not knowing who she is or where she belongs is dealt with really well. Lastly, although I view Ed pretty much as a glorified plot device, I actually really liked her character as well. She doesn't have any character development either, but I found her characterization to be really enjoyable and funny and I really liked how she exited the show.
Although I have some issues with the pacing of the story, for instance there are entire episodes spent on the crew accidentally getting high on mushrooms and fighting black goo, the episodes that impact the overall plot are really well done. And I mean, even the less important episodes are still entertaining to an extent and some of them help expand what we know of the characters.
As to the animation, there's really nothing to say other than that it's amazing. I've said this before, but I really love the aesthetic of older animated shows and films. There's a grittier feel to them that has been lost in the predominantly digital environment of the animation industry. Also, the use of CGI in the show is impeccable. It's used sparingly, but when it is used, it's incorporated flawlessly.
As a last note, I really vibed with the predominantly jazz soundtrack. It really fit the atmosphere of the show.
This show won me over big time. Honestly, I wouldn't mind watching a random episode from the show every now and again in the future, even the one's that aren't as important. Still a bit upset about the ending though. I didn't really understand Spike's overall arc, so I read up a bit on it and man, some things just suck.

                If you aren't really emotionally invested into the characters early on, there is no overarching narrative to hold onto, so the only things that kept me personally watching were the beautiful and painstakingly detailed visual environments and character designs, and the outstanding soundtrack.
And yes, I can appreciate, some of the thematic undertones, relating to personal demons explored in the later episodes of the show, if you don't fall for the characters emotionally, something I imagine is extremely subjective, it may be a little harder to watch, that is less addictive, than other shows with a little more in the way of consistent narrative progression.

                Cowboy Bebop is simply the best anime series. The show is not only a classic but a masterpiece. The story follows a Spaceship filled with a crew of two men, one woman, one teenage girl, and a Welsh Corgi. The characters are forever lasting on your heart when you know their background story. Even the minor characters and non re occurring ones make a memorable impression. The music is perfect for the show and Yoko Kanno eve created The Seatbelts to perform all the songs. Simply a fantastic anime all around. This is one anime I do not mind watching in either English or Japanese.

WARNING: MY OPINION, AN OPINION FROM NOV 2020.
I KNOW THAT THIS IS SOME EPISODIC ANIME bu I'm just gonna be straight about this. This anime is somewhat boring and cliche. Maybe because I've watched way too much anime that I've been through a lot of anime plot lines. The story is simple really, everything just became really good when Julia came in and my fav episode? the LAST episode. It just gave me chills and that's when I felt like ""it was good"". I am so sorry to disappoint CB fans or people who will criticize this review but this is just
                  what I feel. ART * SOUND were decent. Characters were good but I don't see any chemistry around them as a group or teammates? Now did I enjoy it? it's pretty decent. It's not SUPER boring but it's boring. My definition of my boring is that why am I still watching this? This was a classic, gave it a 6 thanks to the first and last episode. I wish there was more. Sorry to disappoint everyone but if you would wanna try it, please try it. This anime was fair enough.",6,onepiecetrash,

                Cowboy Bebop is still, by far, my favorite anime. Though it does have a slow pace, the character development is amazing. By the end of the series I was attached to every one of the characters. Speaking of endings, this series builds up to the very end and gives an emotionally wrenching but satisfying ending. The series is so deep that I have seen it at least 5 times and still enjoy watching it. I encourage anyone who enjoys action, character development, and space to watch this series. It may start off slow but once you're hooked, you're hooked.

                Cowboy Bebop is the first anime I've seen, and hence this will be the first review for an anime that I have written. This show is older than I am, too, so I doubt I'll be able to say much that hasn't already been said, but hopefully you'll find something worthwhile here.
Bebop is a show that constantly feels as though it's showing off, with all that that entails. The presentation is consistently amazing, with an explosive soundtrack, top quality art design and fluid animation that really brings the world (or rather, the solar system), to life. The show draws from many different genres in both
                  its writing and its setting, and the result is a delightfully varied experience that keeps you on your toes for all 26 of its episodes.
The characters in Bebop are varied and interesting. The main crew of the titular ship play off of each other very nicely, with their chemistry making both the serious and comedic moments shine through. Even minor characters, who come pretty non-stop throughout the series, were developed enough to the point where none feel forgettable and each of their little stories were entertaining to watch unfold.
However, to take a negative turn, I often felt while watching that the show was favouring style over substance to a point where parts of the series let me down. For the most part, Cowboy Bebop is episodic, tackling wildly different types of stories and only occasionally keeping an arc going for longer than 24 minutes. While this does mean you're constantly seeing new things, and plays into the excitement that comes from watching it, it does mean that it sometimes suffers from pacing problems, with the odd episode feeling like it's over before it should be, or another lingering too long on a plot that wasn't massively interesting to begin with. While I could never say that I was bored at any point, the stories and their quality can vary slightly too much from episode to episode.
Despite my criticisms, I thoroughly enjoyed Cowboy Bebop and I can see how it gained its status as a classic anime. I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to the medium, and I eagerly await being able to watch and review the movie, as well as more of director Shinichiro Watanabe's work.",8,ConicalMug,

                Okay, I may be a bit suspicious to talk about the work, maybe I overdid it in the notes, no, I do not believe that, but okay, I'll start
I love this anime a lot, and it's funny how I get myself thinking about the work, about the different themes covered and, of course, the sad but great ending, the end of the series really complies with the word, it's an end, you feel complete , May have a taste of want more, but to see that the 26 episodes were satiating
The universe of Cowboy Bebop is very well built, it is already a time when
                  space exploration worked, year 2071 (Unfortunately that year there will be no colony by the Solar System), Bounty Hunters earn a living in this new profession, In a new way of living
The art, as well as other animes of the 90's is fantastic, I find incredible the air that these styles bring, movements, in the action scenes are mainly fluid, and even the expressions of characters fascinate, this looking at every detail of scene, Without mentioning the very good animation that heaven possesses
The music is something else the fantastic part, starting from the opening, Tank! Like other songs that play during the series, and that curiously has a style of Jazz well pulled for the Bebop, and the fantastic music of closing, The Real Folk Blues, same name of the last two episodes, in addition the name of the episodes always has the See with music, and this is too interesting
And what to talk about the characters, my every character very well built, you play a character, and with the passing of the episodes you will know more of each one, the characteristic past of each and what is good, the outcome, Episode for episode You know each character, and I come to talk about the specific episodes of Jet and Faye, first Jet's, which are very engaging and serious, I love the rhythm of these episodes, Faye's, to know about her past Is very good, and I see that these specific episodes of Faye kind of sad because the history of her past is, I will not comment anything, if you want to know you have to watch, not to mention the other main characters like Spike that is a great Protagonist and Ed who is the hyperactive child, can not dislike it, in fact, there is no way to dislike anyone, even Ein, the dog is super charismatic (but I think all dogs are) secondary characters Which appear, such as Andy, Appledelhi (I think is the strongest character in the anime) and Tongpu (His story is very interesting)
The Rhythm of the anime really runs very well, I recommend it to everyone ..........",10,Space_ShyGuy,

                Frankly Cowboy Bebop suffers from its age.
Its got great music, and good animation. But its clear the story and more importantly the animation are limited by the tools available to the studio at the time.
The fights are great and are probably the biggest reason to watch the show, but their so few and far between you can count them on your hands and all in they probably total ten minutes of the whole show.
The music is also really good. It both suits the anime and is enjoyable on its own. Not every track is something I'd enjoy but it all works.
But problems start to emerge
                  with the episode format and the characters.
Each episode follows the same exact thread; new bounty guy shows up, hi-jinks ensue as the Bebop crew try to catch him/her, new character joins the team, plot twist happens to keep the Bebop crew from getting paid, and then bounty guy or random new character dies and everybody is sad.
Every. Single. Episode. And it really doesn't work, I don't care about anyone these characters only get a few minutes of screen time each and then just die for cheap shock value. 
The cast also aren't much better. Jet never really does anything, Faye is just plain annoying, Ed exists to be either a Deus Ex Machina or deliver info dumps, and Spike.
A lot of people really like Spike. I'm not one of them.
He comes across as completely arrogant, like he's too cool to give a damn about his friends or anything. 
He's so unsympathetic and detached that it really makes it hard to root for him, especially when he's ditching the Bebop crew for the sixth time to go do some random thing.
The final issue is one that I admit is very personal and probably wont effect anyone else but its still the one that kills the show for me. 
There is no real sense of stakes. The Bebop crew is always getting beaten up, their ships wrecked and their bounties escaping. But they never suffer anything for it. Oh sure they complain about a lack of money and food. But it never amounts to anything. There is never a moment where they are bared from doing something, ANYTHING because of the constant losses they suffer.
In one episode they establish that in the whole universe, there is one guy who can work on Spike's personal space ship, parts are getting rarer and the repairs are complex and expensive. Then at the end of the episode Spike sheers both wings off the thing and utterly beats the snot out of it.
And in the next episode the ship is completely fine, restored to the same condition it started the series in.
In the third (I think) episode Spike gets shot like five times and launched out a forth story window . And he's completely fine. No long term injuries or anything.
It just really makes me feel like nothing is at risk. I can't feel broke up at the end because the team has been shown to rebound from similar situations in the past with no difficulty too many times. 
I'm not worried about how Jet will fix the Bebop because their ships have been magically fine in every episode. Spike has survived worse injuries than a single bullet and sword cut. Faye is dumb and I don't care about her memories. Ed is the only character I really cared about but she was dumped from the show 3 episodes back for no real reason and no one else showed any concern for her so why should I?
It really lets the show down. Music's still bangin' tho.",6,Ciaran_Zagami,

                Overlooked classic I never watched lived up to it's fame and a OST I fell in love with.
Story: Bounty Hunters in space, while this isn't something that has been touched in fiction before I feel it does it the best. At times it's vague, which it doesn't need to be detailed with certain characters past not being completely explained till later adds to the mystery of some of them and the over all events that lead them meeting each came together pretty well. Had the right amount of comic relief and tension not many shows I feel do it this well no over zealous comedy
                  and it was serious when it needed to be.
Art: For it's time the art is top notch, the environments are well designed, characters aren't all copy-pasted templates they are unique looking. Gives a nice mixture of the wild west, and space mashed together.
Sound: I loved the OST so much I ended up getting it for myself. I'm a fan of jazz, and Cowboy Bebop does it well. The opening song is pretty spicey and smooth got to say it's one of my favorite Opening OSTs to date. Tank, Rush, Space Lion, etc never get's old listening to them.
Characters: The main characters work well together, from the chaos to the sad moments it feels like one of the better choices for bunching them together. Even a lot of side characters weren't dull and many times I was wishing I would see some again. 
Probably the best space bounty anime there is, and it left me wanting a little bit more feeling it ended to quickly.",9,Polaeris,

                ---------------------------------------SPOILER FREE
I usually dont write reviews because if the show is good i just enjoy it and if the show is bad i just ignore it... but its been long since a show ending was so stupid that made me angry..
CB in general is a story with no real meaning behind it more than show the adventures of the most incompetent ream i've seen since Team Rocket, they fail on almost every job making every episode a repetition that make you facepalm over and over and over again.
Sometimes they throw some flashback about characters but that's it, they dont really go deeper than that, until
                  you reach episode 25 and suddenly the story matters and they rush it so bad that the amount of story wholes they leave behind is so big that make me regret starting to watch this show in the first place and i dont wanna even start to talk about how the story ending developed.
I really entered this show with positive hopes and ended up disappointed in a way i didnt think possible. I can now say i really REALLY dont understand what people like about this, it really doesnt deserve the 8 it has, not even a 5 and if im really realistic not even a 4.
i really wanted to like this show and even when i was half way through and i wanted to drop it because of how unentertaining it is, i didnt because i really thought i was gonna finish and at least say ""you know what, after all, it is not a bad show"" but i cant, i really cant.
Dont watch this show, not even because you wanna say ""yeah i watched it"", is not even worth that.",3,Akiraa-kun,

                First off Cowboy Bebop isn't an anime that really needs a review; its success says it all. No matter what you might think about it just hearing about it, this anime really draws you in with its characters and holds you firmly planted in front of your viewing device. Its cleverly placed comedic moments perfectly balance out the overall seriousness of the situations. Its full of action while still having the occasional bit of crack that we all love. In the end, its an anime I would recommend for every fan to watch as a classic of what makes a good anime.
              ",10,CynthiaBennett,

                It seems pointless to review Cowboy Bebop given that in the past 20 years it's been hailed as most likely the best anime ever. And I certainly don't have much to add to that assessment, but I will add my thoughts to the collective wisdom.
First, the art. I absolutely love the retro 60's Golgo 13 inspired style on the landscape and vehicles. If you grew up watching Japanese cartoons from the 60's and 70's like I did, seeing that style updated in such as cool and futuristic way is just the shit. It really contributes to the sparse, lonely atmosphere of the Bebop universe. Just
                  as Japanese cartoons in the 60's and 70's were sparse and bare out of necessity - it was expensive to hand animate everything so they relied on techniques such as panning the camera over static images - the same aesthetic works here.
The characterizations are top notch. Spike, the not-so-bright but very stylistic ex-gangster trying to eke out a living as a ""cowboy"" bounty hunter. Always right on the edge of success but somehow living with failure right in front of his face. You underestimate his skills until he puts them on display and you sit and watch in disbelief as he deftly eviscerates his quarry. I'd cry if my eyeballs hadn't already melted out of their sockets.
Jet, the mysterious ex-cop owner of the Bebop. Has a, let's call it ""complicated"" relationship with Spike and Faye. Hates how much he cares about Spike and relies on his comradeship. Just a guy trying to make a buck in a crazy universe stuck with a bunch of assholes that don't respect him or carry their weight, and he wouldn't have it any other way.
Faye, the femme fatale. Saddled with the soap opera trope of a lost memory, she has become more than the sum of her missing parts. Faye is fiercely independent, completely capable, and the prototype for the modern female lead character. Completely owns every scene she's in and I'd call you a liar if you said you wouldn't watch the shit out of a solo Faye series.
Ed - whatever the hell Ed is - the chaos monkey that knows everything and nothing all at the same time. Where did she get those skills and how does she always manage to tempt fate and synchronize her life completely the opposite of the forces of death to stay alive? We'll never know, unfortunately.
Music: if Cowboy Bebop is legendary for one thing, it's the music. From composition to performance the music is timeless, flawless, and incredible. Do yourself a favor and listen to the soundtrack. 
Favorite episodes: the one where Ed feeds the rest of the crew the magic mushrooms to see if they are safe to eat. Hilarious and sad to watch all at the same time, you feel bad for laughing at Spike's Sisyphean walk up the unending stairs - nah, you don't feel bad. Other favorite episode: Faye's tape, Spike and Jet crawl the bowels of the crumbling city to find the ancient electronics museum and bring back a Beta instead of a VHS. Spike's insistence that it would work if Jet just crammed the tape in the slot the right way is every human's struggle with technology ever. And so exemplary of Cowboy Bebop - a story makes us both laugh and cry with the same breath.

                Cowboy Bepop
One of the most popular and well-known works of the older generation. I didn't grow up with it and never saw or heard of this series in my younger days. It wasn't until this year that I watched it for the first time on recommendation and was pleasantly surprised. 
The anime adaptation of Cowboy Bepop was especially convincing in the detailed realization and illustration of the Sci-Fi genre. Through this, an immensely detailed world was constructed, even if there was virtually no world-building, so the individual detail was in the foreground. 
Furthermore, the anime possesses very impressive and likable characters that have both individual
                  character backgrounds, as well as ambitions. This was well embellished by various amusing conversations and the interaction of the characters. 
However, beyond all the positives, Cowboy Bepop also has certain flaws. First and foremost, this series has a relatively mediocre plot that is not convincing in any way. Very slow pacing and it is relatively episodic.  70% of the anime are only based on small experiences and bounty hunts. 
[Story 4]
The story mostly revolves around the everyday tasks of Jet's crew, who somehow try to keep themselves on their feet by taking on various missions. Unfortunately, luck is not on their side and they usually come up empty or cause more damage than they deserve. 
Along the way, you get to know the respective backgrounds of the 4 main characters and learn where fate will take them. Especially the background of Spike, followed by Fraye were in focus here. Spike's future as well as past with Julia, symbolically formed the rest of the plot and how he wanted to face Vicious.
Overwhelmingly, the result was disappointing, as there was almost no tension and the plot between Spike and Vicious was relatively monotonous. Julia was just an empty shell until the end and the finale resulted in a very weak climax. On the one hand, it's interesting to see how quickly and spontaneously this ending developed. On the other hand, you couldn't get anything out of it. Which left Spike's arc and the actual plot with an average ending.  The extremely slow pacing didn't help the whole thing much.
My favorite were the 2 episodes about the fridge and the mushrooms. 
[Characters 7]
The series was based only on the focus of 4 main characters. The respective side characters that one met in the course of the plot were relatively simple. They had small backgrounds and there were no great developments.
Vicious, who was the main antagonist of the series, was practically a pushover. He was built up with much more drama than he had in terms of influence and character. Compared to the 4 protagonists, he practically disappeared into thin air. 
Faye had the most individual and interesting character arc, which was very much about her personality and development, making her undoubtedly the best character. 
Spike is my personal favorite and I liked his personality a lot, even if it became very dull and linear in the long run. He reminded me quite a bit of ""Patrick Jane"" from ""The Mentalist"".
Jet had a rather simple background, but in my opinion, he had the strongest and most emotional personality, a real Tsundere as it should be.
Ed was mostly a comedy character with a relatively small but significant background. As a humorous character, however, she was more suitable. 
In the end, the characters have been the biggest strength in this anime, through their balanced personalities.
[Animatioen 9]
I was especially fascinated by the backgrounds and their detailed designs, it's been one of the most beautiful post-apocalyptic worlds I've seen.
The actual animations have been very dynamic. 
[Music 6]
Quite a short and individual intro which certainly lingers in the mind, how simple and crisp it was. Musically nothing earth-shattering, but that's not what matters.
The Osts have been very rare and were scattered very scarcely over the series to give respective moments more momentum. This also resulted in many moments lacking atmosphere.
[Conclusion.]
Cowboy Bepop is remarkable for its age and has stood the test of time and has a very good reputation in the community. For me, too, it was an interesting experience to have watched this anime. However, one thing is clear here. Cowboy Bepop has a much stronger appeal to the audience through its character than through the actual content. Although the series has been relatively empty, especially the characters have entertained me very well. 
Whether I will be able to watch it again, however, is unclear.

                This is one of the best animes of all time. It's got great animation, designs, and story. The soundtrack is so energetic and downright a master piece, the opening is so iconic and catchy. 
I'd say the story itself is pretty unconventional, since the main plot is hardly ever touched until the last 3 chapters. But despite that, you get so attached to the characters that it doesn't even matter, and the world building is good enough to keep you engaged.
I watched this during quarantine and it was one of the best experiences of my life, I hardly recommend it. The vibe this anime has
                  going on is indescribable. The world is so believable, and the characters are so fun and badass. The battle sequences are magestic, and just, everything is great.

                Wow. If a review starts with a word normally assosciated with epicness or being left speechless, such as wow, it's a pretty good indicator the product, in this case Cowboy Bebop, is going to be fantastic. Believe me, this is one space oddessy you don't want to miss! Let's get on to the review:-
Story:- Hmm, aahh, what? Yeah, the story is a bit... Mixed, to say the least. I'm 98% certain there's an over-aching story, but most episodes have their own story, which I liked. It meant each episode ""wiped the slate clean"" for want of a better phrase, and made each episode original. One
                  I particularly enjoyed 
*SPOILERS AHEAD, DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED!*
Was the VHS tape episode, as, it being set in 2071, Spike and Jet had no clue how to use it until they found the 20th C tech otaku. Found it hilarious!
*SPOILER END!*
So yeah, the ""umbrella"" story I don't know and don't really understand, but you understand who the good guys and the bad guys are to get a general grip of the show when it comes to it's climatic end. 8/10.
Art:- The show was produced in 1998, and wow has it aged well! Honestly, I mean, there are many space scenes reminiscient of star wars, with all the lasers and guns in space, but from a hand-drawn perspective (which, of course, the show is set in) I just can't believe the amount of detail! There's all the little control panels in the many ships through the series, to the sprawling landscapes of the different (alien to us) worlds. Speaking of worlds... 9/10.
Character:- Oh. My. God. The character in terms of the ""feeling"" of the show and the characters themselves were outstanding. As I've just mentioned, the worlds themselves are brilliantly both familiar and alien. The story is set in 2071, and while this seems like an age away, the late teens to mid twenties guys and gals, myself included, this is going to be in our life-time. We'll be old and decrepit, but alive (hopefully). That Tanabe chose this year, that is, so far yet not too far, is brilliant, as it does mean that it strikes that balance of familiarity and unknown. 
Now, the characters themselves. There are many characters, but I'm just gonna touch upon the four protagonists, from my least favourite to my most. Firstly, then, ED. F*cking Ed! Ed is a, hmm, I'm gonna go around 10 or 12 year old girl, who, in classic anime fashon, looks like a boy. One thing that makes him not a boy is the voice! I cringed and had to turn my volume down every time she went hyper which is, well, most of the time. I like her character (a sort of hyper tech otaku) but it was just the voice, in both sub and dub (I watched the show in sub, before a friend recommended dub. WATCH IT IN DUB ENGLISH VIEWERS!). Second is Faye. Faye is a beautiful woman who joins the Bebop (the ship, y'know, space ship, because it's set in space. OVER-CLARIFICATION FTW) team quite early in the show. I had a big break halfway through the show, but I think she joined around episode 10. She jumps in and out of episodes, being prevalent and then not so much, but she's the woman of the team, and is quite strong-willed, witty and just adds the sense of humor achieved by a woman character. She doesn't follow the traditional women view in anime, which is great!
Next, is a two-way tie, so I'll cover both of them. Spike and Jet, our main protagonists. Jet is Spike's mentor. Not much is known about Jet (except a couple of background episodes, which are NOT flashback episodes, which is always good) but he becomes a loveable character, being a very fatherly figure and caring towards all his crew. I think he owns the Bebop, so he cares very much about the ship too. He also has a fascination with bonsai trees, because why not. Every anime character has to have a wierd fetish, rule #1. For Jet, it's bonsai trees. Hey, he runs the ship, helps out his crew, and cooks. You gotta let him have his moments.
Lastly, is Spike. I love Spike. He is brilliant. He is a 20-something bounty hunter, and uses his guns, martial art-type moves and quick witts to get him out of his many skirmishes he encounters. Despite being the main protagonist and having some ""bone-head"" moments, he's actually the most philosophical of the team. I'm rambling on and don't want to spoil him, so I'll leave it there. 10/10.
Sound:- I realize I am rambling on , so this section is going to be short and sweet. All you have to do for this (AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION!) is go on Youtube and type ""Cowboy Bebop OST"" and then sit back, with a optional beverage and snack, and enjoy. You will not be disappointed, trust me. 10/10
Enjoyment/Overall:- As you've been able to read, I love this show, and will ever be in debt to my best friend who introduced me to the series. However, along with Ed, I have one nitpick. IT'S SLOW! My God, does this show take it's time! Once you get passed, say, the 8 minute mark, it's fine, but this show takes it's sweet. sweet time to get up to speed, then, as per usual, you lose yourself, as you will do in a fantastic anime. Other then that, this is a beautiful, jaw-dropping, action-packed and sometimes sentimental show that will have you laugh,cry, punch the air and rock in the corner all in the space of 5 minutes. Not just a beautiful anime, but an inspiring experience. If ever there was a show to reccommend, it would be this. I can't say it's my favourite, not just because I may find a new favourite, but because I all ready have one, but this is a very close second. Thank you, Tanade, Thank you, Spike, Jet, Faye and even you Ein, Spike's dog. Thank you, Cowboy Bebop. 10/10",10,Waldy565,

                A timeless Anime Classic on par with older gems like the vaunted 'Akira'
One of the finest pieces of television anime ever produced, with superb writing and genius characters. Cowboy Bebop is a powerful narrative with great action set-pieces and masterful noir detective mysteries. The protagonists are a wonderful band of bounty hunting rogues who are full of their share of secrets, in a Solar System filled with bandits and rogues, that the Bebop crew bands together to hunt for the rewards to survive the harsh solar realm of the series. The fantastic worldbuilding and great musical score are complemented by superlative artwork in an anime,
                  which in most respects is rather flawless.",10,MKSTEEL,

                So for my first review I decided to tackle one of the most hyped and well regarded anime around. Hope I'm not being too ambitious.
Cowboy Bebop is, in one word, cool. Everything about it is cool: the soundtrack, the art style, the characters... everything. But the amount of coolness can not hide some of it's problems. It is an overall pretty good show but I found it somewhat lacking in some aspects. So lets start with the things I enjoyed and them move on to what I think it could have done better.
First, I should say that it took me a long time to make
                  up my mind about watching Cowboy Bebop. Even though it was recommend to me endless times, I just couldn't get over the fact that it was a rather old show and that the animation would suck - I'm someone that easily discards shows if I don't like the way they are animated. But it turns out I was wrong! The animation has hold out pretty well and it has something very stylish about it. The character's designs are great - except for Faye's awful even though iconic yellow suit - and the whole universe is full of charisma. The soundtrack is just as great, having one the best opening songs ever - hell I'm listening to it right now just to get pumped to write this review.
The episodes are very entertaining, full of action and funny moments. There are also a few more dramatic episodes and others where you can see they were trying to mimic or mock some genres, which adds to the show. There's some variety to the characters which is a plus and their iterations with each other can by very funny to watch.
But for such an iconic show I was expecting a little bit more of a story. Truth is that in all of the 26 episodes maybe 5 or 6 of them really matter for the plot. Every other episode just repeats more or less the same formula: there's a bounty to catch, Spike, Faye and sometimes Jet go after it, they all get in each other's way, they manage to catch it (or not) and in the end are still broke because they have to pay for all the damage they made. It is entertaining to watch but at some point you start to expect a bit more.
The characters don't really help much in developing the story either. Even though they all have at least one episode dedicated to them individually, they don't really change. Faye is the most frustrating one, having such an interesting back story and not really changing when she finally finds out what she wanted to know.
There are a few episodes about Spike that hint to a very complex and interesting story. This actually seems to be the plot the whole show was supposed to revolve around but it doesn't. This leads to a last episode that even though is cool and has fun action scenes, just seems like it came out of nowhere. In the end none of the characters learned anything and, even though they might have started to care for each other, they don't show it.
I might sound overcritical towards a show that I rated pretty high. The thing is that a see the amount of potencial Cowboy Bebop had. Every episode is entertaining but when it leads to nothing, even though it seemed it wanted to lead to something, it is a bit frustrating. If it was just a show about the daily struggles of the cast I would be completely fine with it. But when it adds Spike's darker story and tries to pass it as a main plot point even though it is brushed off for most of the show I just get confused. I think Cowboy Bebop could lose that whole plot and be just as good, if not better.
But overall, this is a great show that you will certainly enjoy and have fun with. I guess the best way to watch it is just to forget about the hype and not take the story too seriously.",8,hwillow,

                This anime will always have a top spot among GAOAT (Greatest Anime of All Time). Some of the reasons why are clear... a very gripping set of sub plots in each episode that sometimes linger on to the next episode and sometimes are not seen to have lasting effects in the character development. Part of this lack of roll-over into characterization adds a mysteriousness to the tone of anime. This is one of the main reasons why Cowboy Bebop will forever remain in anime watchers' hearts. An amazingly crafted overall tone that intertwines with the plot, leaves strikingly unique characters that in our present day
                  are imitated by cos-players regularly. 
The themes in the anime were not that of minor ideologies, but delivered strong themes that could cause drastic changes in people's lives. I couldn't imagine that this anime has not changed many peoples' lives in regards to how they think about life. The creativity for the sub-plots is congruent to an author's dream to write a whole book that would inspire readers. But Cowboy Bebop is able to deliver stories of similar impact in a single episode. All this is done in a futuristic world with old-school animation where the ideas for technologies and methods of doing daily tasks requires true creative genius.
Returning to the reason why Cowboy Bebop is so influential, a single reason cannot actually explain its impact, but a good watch of the anime should be able to do the trick. heh.",10,Kimchigopro,

                A true classic. Cowboy Bebop is a sort of slice-of-life anime about retro futuristic bounty hunters in the 2070's attempting to keep food on the table and nab their next head. Warning, very biased review.
Story: 10
Fantastic, as I said, it's mostly slice of life, but don't let that dismay you (unless you love that sort of thing, like I do), for each episode has a fun to watch adventure (or non-adventure, I suppose) that really is delightful.
Art: 10
I find the griminess of its 1990's animation somewhat endearing and very pleasant to look at, even if it might not be as clean as the modern art
                  style.
Sound: 10
Tank! is an iconic opening, if I've ever heard one. And Real Folk Blues is a great ending, as well. The voice acting (dub) is one of the best that I've heard, each voice fits the characters very very well.
Character: 10
Their characterizations are very well-done, quirky, and overall incredibly enjoyable to watch them interact with whatever the situation is.
Enjoyment: 10
I watched the first two episodes and let it sit for about six months before picking it back up again, promptly devouring the rest of the series post-haste. I loved it to bits and miss the characters already.",10,tothebirds,
1,"
                Having watched Cowboy Bebop for the first time back in the early 00s, I was really curious to see how it would pass the test of time. After all, not all great series have the same impact on you on a second run. However, this was not the case for Cowboy Bebop, a series so brilliantly crafted that it really makes you reconsider the quality of some of the shows currently airing.
In my opinion, characters are one of the most outstanding aspects of this show. With four main leads, it would have been easy to make them stick together all the time and create one
                  storyline for all of them to fit in. However, notwithstanding the importance of ‘team moments,’ I love how personal background has such a big role in this show, with flashbacks and encounters from the past casting light over the people we see on the screen.
Character development is one of the main reasons why each episode feels so important in terms of where the show is going. There might not be a big end goal for these four misfits, but you remain hooked until the very end because you still want to get to know them more. What in other shows would be considered ‘filler episodes’ has a different importance in Cowboy Bebop, where absolutely nothing goes to waste. Even the secondary characters that you meet along the way are memorable and you wish you will see them again at some point in the future.
Despite being shot 20 years ago, the action scenes are still pretty amazing – I actually wish there were more. However, considering the aim is to mix different ingredients (comedy, drama, romance, sci-fi), everything seems perfectly balanced.
Finally, a word about the soundtrack. The opening titles are some of the most iconic in TV animation, and the use of jazz tracks throughout the series really stands out as an inspired director choice. I would listen to this soundtrack over and over.",10,MyrBet,

                Cowboy Bebop is good, but I don't think it deserves a rating of 8.9/10 which is incredibly high. There are plenty of good moments in Bebop, but at the same time you need to give a lot of patience to fully appreciate the show. From time to time, there are some good episodes, but most of the time it is just average or acceptable, but the thing is that I don't think there is a single bad episode. There is definitely an episode for you somewhere which will make you appreciate life, because Bebop at its essence is a slice of life of these individual
                  characters.
It is episodic in nature, so the best way to judge its quality is to ask how many episodes are considered worth-watching? In my opinion, there are about 8 out of the 26 episodes that I consider a must watch, these are: Ballad of Fallen Angels(ep. 5), Heavy Metal Queen(ep. 7), Mushroom Samba(ep. 17), Speak like a child(ep. 18), Pierrot le Fou(ep. 20), Brain Scratch(ep. 23) and The Real Folk Blues part 1 and 2(ep. 25-26) with each deserves a rating of 7.5/10 to 8.5/10. The remaining 18 out of the 26 episodes ranges from 5/10(average) to 7.4/10 which for me, drag the show down. 
Characters: 7.5/10
- The characters have a sense of coolness attached to them. They are very likable and have depth to their writing. They are very reasonable and deserve sympathy. They deserve more screen time especially Ed and Ein. The good moments of Bebop come from the individual character arcs. The show would be better if we get to see more of these characters.
Story: 7/10
- The main story of Spike which comprises of episodes 5, 25, and 26 is definitely the best and I think deserves at least an 8/10. Taking everything into consideration however, with some average and fine episodes, it's just a 7/10.
Art and Sound: 8/10
- For its time, it looks good and captured my senses. The classical sound is very fitting to the show and it made the good moments even better.
Enjoyment: 7/10
- Will I ever watch this show again? Probably not, but there are moments worth a replay.",7,HanezeveAbyss,

                Very rarely, if ever, do I feel so strongly about a product, offering or service so much that I feel compelled to write a review about it. Cowboy Bebop falls on the very end of the positive side of that spectrum. If you are wholly unfamiliar with Cowboy Bebop, well, read the summary on it's page.
I've never really watched a lot of anime. A few episodes of some intensely popular anime such as Death Note and Shigeki no Kyojin aside, the medium is foreign to me. However, the immense praise that I've seen for Cowboy Bebop on the internet combined with the comfort of it
                  being readily available to watch on Netflix, enticed me to give the show a shot. I am very, very glad I did.
The way Bebop is built up is fairly interesting. The show is quite episodic; on a practical standpoint, every main character (Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed) have a few episodes that are basically 'their' episodes, focusing most entirely around those characters. These episodes mostly tap into these characters being confronted in some form with their past. What in my opinion are the best episodes, are the episodes centered around Spike. These tense, dramatic episodes, is where in my opinion Cowboy Bebop excels even further than it already does. Beautiful animation, woven deftly with what is the most amazing score to any film/series I have ever seen, while you are slowly being let into more and more of Cowboy Bebop's secrets. The first minute of the show is practically the plateau on which Spike's story is built, making his episodes especially rewarding. It gives a more consistent tone to what is otherwise, like I said before, a fairly episodic show.
Overall, I have enjoyed Cowboy Bebop immensely. It's a sight to behold, a glory to listen to. It's enthralling, and relentlessly clever. I recommend it immensely.",10,Eclipserino,
1,"
                This is an awesome anime! It's probably my all-time most favorite anime. Once in a while I'll go back and watch the last two episodes just so I don't forget why I like it so much.
The music, for one thing. Seatbelts is an awesome group and I wish I could find some of their non-Cowboy Bebop music because I would definitely listen to it plenty.
The story is probably the best part in my opinion. How mysterious Spike's past is, and yet how clear it becomes without even having a character recount the occurrences. And then the ending itself, that's something else. I won't spoil anything,
                  but if you see all the stuff that happens in the first 24 episodes then you'll know why the last two are so open-ended.
Art, geez, that doesn't even need to be said. Some of the visual effects they use can ordinarily only be captured on film, and yet they use most of them to the nth degree. Their portrayal of certain scenes are so perfect that I don't think Hayao Miyazaki himself couldn't have done a better job.
All in all, 10/10 because it's just that great.",10,Miyushuri,

                Title: Cowboy Bebop
What is it: Firefly if it was an anime with half the characters (which, BTW, you should also watch. If you don't know what Firefly is, it's pretty much a space western)
How good is it: 9/10
What is it rated? MA for cursing, brief nudity and (ironically) little (though bloody) violence.
Where to watch: There's the 25 (or 26, not going to check right now) episode series that's available on Funimation, and the movie that's on Netflix DVD. Watch the movie before episode 22, as there will be SUPER MASSIVE SPOILERS after that. One of the best dubs out there.

                Cowboy Bebop. Cowboy Bebop. Cowboy Bebop. If there was any anime that I heard such raving reviews about more than Cowboy Bebop, I don't know what it is. People were telling me right and left that Bebop was the best anime ever. So, I finally had to check it out. I did. And my final opinion: it was really good. It is pretty easy, though, for me to write my likes and dislikes about the show. First, dislikes, I'll just get it over with. The episodic nature of the show. I have never really been a fan of episodic shows, sure they add great character
                  development to the show, but I have a sense of longing, waiting for something, like the story, that never comes, or doesn't satisfy me. Though now that I understand the show much more, especially the themes of longing and alienation, it is fitting that a show sort of holds the viewer to the same expectations as the characters. Something that has made me love the show even more.
Now, here comes what I liked about the show. The characters and the music. If I loved anything about Cowboy Bebop, it was the music. The intro song, Tank!, does exactly what I think an intro should do: get the viewer excited to watch each episode, which it did and more. The outro, on the other hand, The Real Folk Blues, does exactly the opposite. It is filled with a sense of melancholy and longing, which was also perfect. After a couple episodes I felt the loneliness of many of the characters and the outro perfectly captured my emotions. I was so impressed by the music that I looked up who was in charge of it, Yoko Kanno, and I just wanted to give her all the praise in the world. The last time I heard a soundtrack so amazing was after Silent Hill 2. It was that great. 
The characters also make Cowboy Bebop what it is. Spike, Jet, Faye and Edward (you too, Ein!) were a joy to adventure with. They each had drastically different personalities, something I love, and had their own interesting stories to tell. Learning their back stories was like a punch in the gut and made me fall for each character even more. 
All and all, Cowboy Bebop is a show that deserves all the praise it gets. I don't hold onto this show maybe the same way that others do, but I admire and respect its craft. I'm sure after more time has passed and I rewatch it a couple more times, I will love it as much as some others do but until then ...  See You Space Cowboy.",8,denderaebbw,

                Cowboy Bebop is an critically acclaimed Japanese science fiction anime led by director Shinichiro Watanabe. The 26-episode series deals with topics such as loneliness, existential boredom and the difficulty in facing our past.
Although it was been premiered in 1998, which means that it was released more than 20 years ago, it does not mean in any way that it is outdated. 
It is a captivating, unique and innovative work for the time it was launched. Clearly inspired by the “western” and “noir” films of the 40s, the series features a soundtrack with elements of Jazz, blues and classic rock that fit the theme perfectly.
The main
                  plot focuses on 2071 where the Earth became uninhabitable and humanity was forced to colonize the planets and moons of the Solar system. With this sudden expansion of humanity, the crime rate has skyrocketed and it has become increasingly difficult to contain. In the midst of all this situation, Inter Solar Space Police (ISSP), created a system of contracts where bounty hunters immobilize criminals and bring them alive in exchange for a payment, very similar to the Wanted system of the old western, making with these hunters to become known as ""Cowboys"".
The protagonists of the plot are a group of bounty hunters who operate on a ship they call Bebop. The main group consists of Spike Spiegel, a renegade Mafia assassin and Jet Black, a former ISSP officer. As the story progresses the group gets bigger, with the entrance of Faye Valentine, a delinquent woman who lost her memory, Radical Edward, a girl who is excellent at hacking and Ein, a modified corgi in the laboratory with an intelligence similar to human.
This group of extremely captivating and entertaining characters roams the space in search of criminals to obtain their due reward. Each episode is a different journey that captivates us to watch more, while we discover more of the morbid and tragic pasts of the characters that hold us to the plot, reaching a final that I consider perfect, where the story ends in an incredible way.
I really admire this work and consider it on of the best plot and group of characters I have seen to date. That group of former thugs, officers and hackers captivate the viewer to watch in an unusual way, making each character and episode memorable and unforgettable.
Cowboy bebop is a great animation series for those who like action, mystery and drama movies, or even for those who enjoy a good classic of investigation and western. And I recommend anyone to watch for its excellent quality and for its extraordinary ending that is recorded as one of the best works developed to date.
""You´re gonna carry that weight""",10,IamManiac,

                One of the classical gems, personally I am very picky with my anime. The first time I encountered Cowboy bebop was in 2001. At the age of eleven I fell in love with cowboy bebop and when I grew up it played a large role in defining my taste in the genre.
I'm not obsessed with Japanese culture but I respect good anime when I watch it. Quite honestly I dislike a lot of anime too but cowboy bebop just overall was and is so good.
While episodic in nature each individual story really sets up and tells the stories of these bounty hunters, that was the
                  point, in my opinion of having individual stories set in individual episodes. Bebop isn't about some hero trying to save the world from evil. It's about the lives of the crew, what they do to survive, they are just people with extraordinary pasts, that have specialized skills for the jobs they perform. It's a gathering of different personalities that after awhile they grew onto each other and this is reflected later on.
Once the ""main arc"" of the story reveals itself it turns into quite a roller coaster, and each character obviously has their own back story revealed in their respective episodes. If you're looking for a cliched anime obviously this won't probably do it for you but for fans that are looking for more. This show is for you. 
The only way I can see you even having anything negative about this show is if you're trying to be a hipster or search for things you dislike. There is games, anime etc i have personally disliked but i could respect that game or movie for being good but sometimes things don't click with you. That's Bebop, it's a classic. Hate it or love it, you have to respect it.",10,greyitem,

                Well, if this isn't the poster child for ""a pure and true anime classic"" I don't know what would be. Cowboy Bebop is visually dated but is otherwise timeless and it has rightfully gone down, and will continue to go down, as one of the greatest anime series ever.
Art-
The art was perfectly fine, if not quite good, for it's time and it is now, understandably, a bit dated. Reviewing this anime in the present as opposed to objectively for when it was created, the art is likely the weakest point of the show, but that's largely because everything else is exceptionally good and time has
                  been kind to the other aspects of the show.
Sound-
Cowboy Bebop has one of the most acclaimed soundtracks ever. The opening sequence is among the greatest of all time, the jazz throughout the series is exciting and of high quality and the perfect song always seems to play during any given action sequence. I don't see how any objective person, regardless of personal taste, could give the sound of Cowboy Bebop anything other than a 10.
The voice acting is solid and there are no low points, but the outstanding soundtrack steals the show in the sound department.
Character-
The characters and the story are likely the biggest factor as to what makes this anime truly special. The crew is super memorable, the lead is one of the most iconic anime badasses of all time and the sheer variety of villains, planets, scenarios and mini-stories, which eventually build up to an exceptionally good ending, combine to make one of the overall most unique and memorable experiences in the history of the medium.
This anime truly has a little bit of everything and it just works. Other shows have tried to replicate this and they almost always end up a convoluted mess but Cowboy Bebop pulls this off masterfully in a way no other show, prior or since, has been able to achieve.
Enjoyment-
There isn't a single episode without action, there's a plethora of gunfights and fist fights and you genuinely give a damn about the characters and the trouble they're getting into, so it's damn near impossible not to enjoy this show. There are so many stories contained within the overall larger narrative and many of them have feel good endings that simply make you happy to watch. Perhaps how enjoyable the show is to watch, even all this time later, is the biggest reason it has aged so well and is still so revered today.
Overall-
A timeless classic and a masterpiece, Cowboy Bebop, while old and visually dated by today's standards, is one of the greatest anime series of all time.
+Pulls off the ""a little bit of everything"" formula perfectly
+Amazing music

                This review isn't going to go into huge detail one why it's a masterpiece that should be evident. I will say the only real problems people commonly find with the show are due to it's age. (clinches/sub par animation, ect) and that's just plain not fair to say that about a 1990's anime.
When infact those common problems were actually non issues during the time, and infact some would say those problems you didnt like were ground breaking at the time. 
Simply put. If you don't like cowboy bebop, you don't like anime. Im assming most of the dislikes came from people who insist that one

                what can i say about this one except that its a classic...Arguably the best show i have even seen. Great characters, great plot, classic storytelling, classic music and great direction.
The best aspect i like about this anime is the simplicity in the portrayal of characters and their behavior in all sequences. The remarkable sections are the comedy ones where no overstressing is used to underline the humour. The humour sequences are simple and to the point and downright funny..they have to be in that avatar. The dark characters are well created and well placed in the plot and no overtures of positivity are introduced in
                  these characters at any point of time which is refreshing. 
I fell in love with the music of the show right from the word go. Jazz rocks! and you've got to be down with that. The sophistication in music is evident from the sounds of the classic jazz orchestras and brass bands. Even the saxophone and harmonica bits played during the scenes and sequences are quite catchy. The build up to one of the great endings that i have ever seen in anime is fantastic. Each character is given color along the way and the show keeps your interest utill the last frame...which is quite a scence really.

                There is no greater purpose in Cowboy Bepop, no goal to work towards, only a past to come to terms with. Underneath the no care attitude of the Bepop crew lies a deep sense of ambiguity and turmoil as each member makes repeated shallow attempts to supress their past tragedies with meaningless day to day activities. Only to find themselves where they were at the start of each episode, staring at the bottom of a bowl of bell peppers and beef without the beef.
“I was watching a dream I could never wake up from. Before I knew it, the dream was over.”
Cowboy Bepop is not
                  for everyone, and I sincerely mean that. The reason why it is regarded as a cult classic amongst the diehard fans of the genre is an enigma in itself. A 90’s anime boasting gunslinging space cowboys and thrilling fight sequences seems like the tools used to create a decent anime. However, chief director Shinichirō Watanabe utilised these staples of the shonen genre in order to create something so needlessly melancholic that not only does it shatter our perceptions of the suave protagonists we wish to be, but the very nature of life itself.
Plot 8/10
Mellow and carefree Spike Spiegel and his boisterous and pragmatic counterpart, Jet Black, try to make a living by chasing bounties across the galaxy in the year 2071 aboard their ship, the Bepop. As they travel, they reluctantly welcome others aboard who share more in common than they think.
Cowboy Bepop is fairly episodic in nature, each episode there’s a new bounty to collect and on the surface, there seems to be no overarching plot. The crew aboard the ship are merely used as vessels by Mr Watanabe in order to give us a glimpse into a minor character’s life and help them achieve their goal. Whilst this is enjoyable to watch, the overall theme of the show is one of despair, episode after episode, a relentless barrage of excessive heartache as another minor character loses something they once cherished, only to be forgotten after the credits roll. Even the crew themselves are not exempt from this grief, Mr Watanabe reminds us that no one can escape this harsh reality as every now and again he turns his focus to the very past the space cowboys try so hard to suppress.
Characters 9/10
The entire Bepop crew is filled with unique characters that complement each other quite well. For every calculated measure there is a spontaneous decision, for every suave action there is an uproar of laughter. It’s fun watching their interactions and how each of them behave in a certain situation. However, beyond that each member has a past life that calls out to them, longing for them to return in order to complete their story. Reminders are placed intermittently throughout the anime simply to showcase that they cannot run away without losing something, and whether they answer the call or not… well that’s for you to find out.
The supporting characters within this anime are an excellent means of a plot device for each episode, where all of them have been uniquely created with their own wants and desires. I found most episodes enjoyable and discovered that the key to gauging how good an episode is, is by how distinctive each supporting character’s goals are. Episode “Pierrot Le Fou” comes to mind.
Art and Sound 9/10
Being a late 90’s anime, Cowboy Bepop’s art style is much different to what you’re probably used to, but it holds up well to this day. The anime features a beautiful array of different planets across the galaxy with an imaginative display of how each society functions. Metropolitan planets are teeming with corporations whilst barren planets are left for those who are only focused on surviving. The imagery within the anime itself is very strong, each episode uses a different gradient scheme and highlights objects that make their appearances throughout the entire show and serve as aforementioned reminders to the characters.
The Bepop type of jazz, identifiable by its complex harmony and rhythms, is a heavy influence for this anime. Evidently seen in the spaceship’s name, episode’s titles, and most importantly, the music. Bepop is littered throughout the soundtrack and it is an amazing experience to listen to it both within the context of the anime and by itself. The soundtrack is full of energy lending to the intense fights scenes, whilst also toning itself back when required during a sombre moment.
Final Remarks
Cowboy Bepop is by far an excellent anime, full of vibrant sceneries and exciting action scenes with the unique flair the crew carries. But underneath that is what turns a decent anime into, well… a cult classic. The lasting impression that sets Cowboy Bepop apart leaves is sad and frankly, uncalled for. The thought that upsets the natural progression of shonen animes in order to address the bleakness of life and how…

                Alright, my first review here so let's get right into it. 
Cowboy bebop, where do I even begin... For me, this anime was a rollercoaster of  ride. At the beginning I enjoyed getting to know all these characters and how they slowly become a part of each others lives. But around the 7th episode, I couldn't keep watching it. I asked my friends who had watched this show whether this will ever get interesting, in the sense, whether there is a bigger story that all this is leading up to or whether this is just an episodic anime series, which by the way I
                  don't like. They couldn't give me a straight answer and now I understand why. 
If you're seeing this review and you're someone who doesn't enjoy episodic series, then pay heed to my advice and watch Cowboy Bebop. No matter how it may seem, there is a bigger story in this anime. I was bored to death till around the 13th episode, but then I started paying attention to details. Every episode has some or the other reference to the characters' pasts. Sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's blatant, but it's present. Things get interesting somewhere around the 20th episode (Also this depends on the person. For me it was interesting from the 20th episode, for someone else, it may be before that or after that) and everything starts to fall into place in the final 3-4 episodes.  I liked the story that cowboy bebop was trying to tell, it was... how do I describe it... Philosophical. I won't speak more, but all I say is WATCH THE SHOW.
After seeing me write so many positive things about the show, you might be wondering why I have given it an 8. Let me justify my rating here. 
I liked the ending, I really did, but it's those 7-8 episodes in the first half of the show for me. Don't get me wrong, they weren't extremely bad, but I found them really boring. I slept halfway through one of the episodes too. If it weren't for the ending being so good, I would have probably rated this a 5 or possibly even a 4 because like I said, I don't enjoy episodic anime series. But Cowboy Bebop is much more than that, and I think majority of the people here won't find the first half of the show boring because some of the stories in the episodes are really compelling and you won't even realize how time passes by.",8,rangerdog,

                Cowboy Bebop is, essentially, an American-style ""Western."" Set in Space. To an awesome and varied soundtrack, as our anti-heroes bebop around the solar system, from the moon of Saturn to the clouds of Venus, collecting bounties on various criminals, trying to avoid their various troubled and mysterious pasts.
But...
There's a lot of tropes and stereotypes played with masterfully, ironically, humorously, and, strangely enough, straightly, throughout the series, blending East-Meets-West in a delectable fusion not unlike it's outstanding soundtrack.
Blues; Jazz; Rock; Western; Classical; the list goes on-and-on, each ""style"" represented and counterpointed by its particular episode.
Science Fiction. Comedy. Drama. Action/Adventure. Cowboy Bebop has something for everyone. And,
                  unlike most series that tries to be ""everything for everyone,"" Cowboy Bebop somehow manages to succeed.
Watching Cowboy Bebop is only half the experience; listening is as much a part of the pleasure. Like putting on your headphones and cuing up your favorite playlist of various styles of music, and letting each piece pull your emotions this-way-and-then-that, until at the end, you're satisfied and yet strangely melancholy; you've laughed, you've cried, you've reminisced fondly in turn.
That's Cowboy Bebop.",10,Ash_DuQuennes,

                I normally hate anything with a futuristic theme, but this was different.  The setting, art, and music are all outstanding.  There is a strangely relaxing flow to Cowboy Bebop that makes the series just fly by.  Each episode I was more focused on the setting than the actual story, but the story was good enough for me to watch every episode, which is saying a lot.

                Aaa Cowboy Bebop, the classic everyone -must- see, and then ideally praise!
But what if.. What if it did have some flaws, like just about any show? ^^;
Okay so, in this anime, we're in the future; the year 2077 or something like that. And yet, we're still using technology from the 90's, because this show was made some time ago. It's a fun contrast, actually! I enjoy the innocent, jazzy, backwards sci-fi setting - including -literal- cowboys, indians, and more!
In this universe, humans have conquered space and are living on all sorts of different planets. It's hard to police it all, so the government pays bounty
                  hunters to help them out catching criminals.
Spike, our MC, is one of these bounty hunters, and over the course of the show, he will gather a motley crew of very special people to try and live a semi-honest  life catching bad people on his spaceship, bebop. Tadaa!
It is fun to see the characters introduced and develop, and go on their episodic adventures to try and earn a living often failing due to circumstances.
The best part, other than the fantastic setting, is the character interactions. All characters feel vibran and a live, with unique characteristics and motivations.
The soundtrack is jazzy and smooth, and the animation is surprisingly good for its time, living up just fine even now!
BUT!
.. There isn't really an overarching plot.. ^^; And that might have been fine, if there really had been nothing, and it just was happy space adventures. But, about 6 episodes out of 25 try to go really deep. Sometimes, it's some personal backstory, and it's kinda ok - but then it gets immediately discarded again.
I guess, my main issue is with the ""main"" villain, Vicious, who is edgy as can be, has a sword in the future, survives explosions on a daily basis, and who doesn't get given nearly enough screentime to care about. So, in the final battle, we've only seen him for 10-odd minutes, and hardly know why it is a final battle at all. And, the battle itself, honestly is rather lackluster. And then it's over!
There's also something about a love-interest, who literally is around for only 1 episode.. :(
It had potential, if they had spent some more time on it, it could've worked out. Or, it could have been happy space adventures. Instead, it was an in-between, and that didn't work for me - the ending fell flat.
THAT SAID. It's still a fine series overall, especially for the time. Probably something good is that anyone can watch it, even non-anime fans.

                Story 9/10
     Though many of the stories/problems end in an episode, I think the viewers will find themselves enjoying most of the 26 episodes with the unique bounties, ways they catch them, the fighting scenes, and the slowly revealing tragic past of the characters. The last few episodes were very intense, and the ending was very shocking but I also believe they were able to wrap up the show perfectly. I myself did not enjoy all of the episodes though, there were maybe one or two episodes where I wanted more fighting scenes or more accomplishments.
Characters 10/10   The characters in this anime all have their own originality and are unique. The protagonist of this anime, Spike Spiegel and one of the crew members, Edward are now one of my favourite characters. As each and one of the crews have different personalities, each and one of them stands out and they are all important to the story. The characters were very well developed, it was nice to see all of them change as they met and interacted with one another. It was nice to learn more about the characters in a very nice timing, I think they were able to decide on the best places to include the characters' sorrowful hidden past and helped the viewer feel connected to the characters.
Music 10/10
     The music played in this anime are just awesome. They are songs that makes one move along with the rhythm and the opening and ending songs are just so catchy and cool. I believe Yoko Kanno did a truly and unbelievably amazing work. All of the songs matches the scenes and none of them seemed to be out of place.
Art 10/10
   By comparing the art of this anime to the other 90's anime art, you can easily see how high quality the art of Cowboy Bebop is. Even if you compare the art of an anime that has been aired recently to Cowboy Bebop, the art quality of cowboy bebop may be better. The character design is very stylish and the fighting scenes are very well drawn. 
Overall 10/10
     I really enjoyed this anime, it is now one of my favourite. The high quality fighting scenes, the characters with tragic pasts which made me want to encourage them and made me feel connected to them, and the last few episodes which were very intense and made me very nervous are some reasons why I ended up loving this anime. I was very satisfied with the ending, I think the anime was able to end very nicely. The art and songs are also high quality, the opening song did not leave my head for a very long time after watching the anime. Finally, the characters are all unique, each characters act as a different and special spice for the anime. In conclusion, I highly recommend this anime and hope all of you will be able to enjoy this as much as me.",10,96kuro,

                There’s a lot I like and dislike about Cowboy Bebop. The characters are all fun and likeable. Ed was a little too “lol so random XD” in the beginning for me, but I warmed up to her. The world, as well as the fusion between the retro and futuristic technology was inspired. Unfortunately, that's about all I liked. One of the series biggest flaws it the overarching story. I didn't think it was very interesting.  It was best when it was about four likeable characters and worst when it had to go back to the overarching plot (not a controversial stance, I’ve heard). Also,
                  the show could be cryptic at times, with the character spouting dialogue that sounds deep but means nothing upon examination. It’s not a bad show, in fact it’s very good, but I expected more from what is considered the best anime ever made.",6,toastalchemist,

                STORY: Cowboy Bebop involves episodic moments of a team of intergalactic bounty hunters catching criminals for rewards. It also contains some references and origins/flashbacks of the main characters. There are also a cool action/fighting scenes, but it can be quite comedic too. The show also lets the viewers sees what life in space looks like and the fate of planet Earth.
CHARACTERS:
Spike: Bounty Hunter, hates pets, kids and women with attitudes, born in Mars, smoker, lazy and practices martial arts.
Jet: Former officer, bounty hunter, owner of the Bebop, chef, mechanic and pilot, and has cybernetic body parts.
Faye: smoker, sarcastic, tough but kind hearted.
Ein: Corgi, cute and
                  funny, & has a close relationship with Ed.
Ed: Youngest member in the group, usually talks about herself in third person, intelligent, human, has a close relationship with Ein.
OVERALL:
A lot of people have talked about this anime. To be honest, I didn't watch it when it first came out during the 90's (until recently -- since Chris convinced me to watch it with him together). I enjoy the adventures in every episode where the group has to catch bounties of wanted criminals while it contains some backstory of the main characters. They also meet some new characters along the way. If I wanted to make any comments about improvements... I would have to say... MORE opportunities and episodes of the backstories of the main characters. Even though it is nice to see some sub-plots for couple of the main characters, it would be nice if the rest of the characters can get a chance too. I would love to learn more about them.",7,nanakox21,

                An absolute masterpiece of an anime!
Cowboy Bebop is a gorgeous slice of life anime filled with interesting characters, stunning visuals and incredible background scores. With fluid fight sequences and homage to different genres and cultures, each episode is unique in itself and bursting with art and life. 
This is an anthology series at it's finest and people complaining about a lack of continuity or motive to the series need to read up on the meaning of an ""Anthology format"" and perhaps veer away from it altogether. 
Cowboy Bebop was, is and will always be a timeless classic, and it has arguably, one of the best,
                  most fulfilling endings to a story in anime history.

                I normally don't write reviews for anime but I found that I should write one for this one. I was surprised that something with this much age could still be relevant today. I adored the music and the interaction of all the characters. I knew however that though Spike longed to be with Julia it would never happen. Their life together was doomed from the start because something that genuinely doesn't exist in reality and rarely in stories. I enjoyed the crew of Spike, Ed, Ein, Faye, and Jet. I felt that in some way they all needed each other to fight against the boredom
                  of the emptiness of space. They are all searching for meaning in their lives and searching for something that will pull them out of the dullness of life. Just moving on and through life just as bounty hunters of the old west frontier did.

                I want to preface this review by saying that the ""classic"" armor that this show has been given is a pile of shit. If you don't like it, don't be discouraged to let it be known. The show certainly has its issues.
But fuck all that for now, let me tell you why I'm giving it a solid 10.
The art, considering the show was made in the 90's, is absolutely superb. Everything about this show's art is as it should be.
The story, which I will not spoil, is absolutely masterminded (apart from a couple of things here and there). It goes in and out with a
                  bang.
The music, oh my god, the music. Every time I listen to that opening theme my dick is at half mast.
The characters are simple and complex at the same time, and they compliment each other quite well, in most cases. This is where my few issues with the show come into play.
Overall my enjoyment of the show is about as high as it's ever been for any other. In my humble and often bullshit opinion, it's a masterpiece.

Arguably one of the greatest anime of all time not just in my opinion but in the eyes of a vast majority of the anime community, Cowboy Bebop aired 20 years ago this year and it is still be watched by fans young and old, new or veteran and will likely be watching for the next 20 years too.
This Anime has it all with a storyline that is always there but only comes to the foreground when it is needed, one of the greatest OST of any anime past or
                  present, an enriching and detailed animation that puts alot of the newer stuff to shame and a cast of characters that fit perfectly in the entire series.

Here we go Cowboy Bebop, personal i see this as one of the classic greats its got a great episodic feel to it that doesn't feel boring like most other anime.
Now when i got into anime this was one of those i was told i had to watch as its a classic and of course you have to watch the classics and personally i don't like that as an argument so long as you can back this up but this is one of those moments where i get hypocritical where this is just one of those moments where i gotta say you gotta.
Every episode
                  has a different chase that makes you love this show the more and more you watch it, the show is just one of those gold greats that shouldn't really work but it does the space cowboy theme true justice and has some top notch comedy and characters.

When strong animation is combined with such an incredible storyline, along with extraordinary music we get a masterpiece like this. It isn't a show only about space, noir, tragedy, romance, fun, philosophy, etc. But it's a show with each episode different from its last one in every sense.
The world where it takes place is beautiful in itself. Spaceships fly through hyperspace gates and on the other hand pilots use handguns on their jets, where the technology is way too advanced and problems of politics and crimes still exist.
Coming to music, which definitely was the strongest point of the series. Yoko Kanno created music that was
                  not only fresh but way ahead of its curve, and I am pretty sure it laid some foundation for the anime music industry for the future. CB used the music to its maximum effect. There were some scenes where not the visuals but the audio made it more splendid.
Honestly admitting, where I thought anime was just supernatural powers who beat evil, schoolgirls, adolescent boys with a ton of life problems, and robots. CB tells us that there was never a boundary to this 2D world. Even their motivation was not what we expect from the usual ones. Never did they do something to fight crime or ensure peace, they just did it for fun and money.
From fistfights to shoutouts in bars, from car chases on roads to aerial fights, from space chases to cool rides, Bepop didn't have a limited spectrum of stuff. The character development(both light and dark) was mixed with humor and a pinch of sad feelings.
Keeping aside the jaw-dropping ending never had I seen such a show with such style, music, and intelligence.

To write a review on this feels literally impossible. I watched the first 2 episodes and was like nah this is not for me. This was after I watched Samurai Champloo which I loved. But I just kept hearing mentions of the series as a masterpiece. So I decided I hadn't given it enough chance and so I decided to carry on 6 months later right on to episode 3. If only I had watched another episode, I might have not made the mistake of thinking the show was just gonna be cliche and trying to be cool. But Spike is

""Masterpiece"" is a word that people like to throw around when talking about Cowboy Bebop. As you can see with my rating I don't really agree with that statement when describing this show. While it is magnificent in it's art/animation and GODLY soundtrack my overall enjoyment suffers because of the episodic nature of the show. I don't really like episodic type show as it doesn't really gives me any urgency or drive to keep going to the next episode. I do like Mushishi  but difference being that show doesn't really
                  have an ultimate goal or main plot but Cowboy Bebop does. 
There is also the characters. They are very good characters but a little more episodes would have been great to give more focus on what they think in their heads since all them have some sorts of secrets. My main complain is with one character that is the main villain. He was extremely under-developed even when they were showing him as the ultimate bad guy.

I mean I don't even like jazz, but this got me to be like ""Wow, jazz is actually pretty awesome!"" Don't let that sentence fool you either, the soundtrack is a mix of genres, not just jazz.
There are so many things going on, but they are woven together beautifully. If I had to pick a favorite episode, it'd probably be Hard Luck Woman. Edward is my favorite character, and I

                This is my first review, so bear with me
Cowboy Bebop was an anime I heard about for quite sometime so I decided to give it a shot, with all previous interest
Story 9/10- The Story is Great, it highlights themes like boredom, loneliness, and most importantly the inability to escape your past and move forward. The anime is episodic, which can take some adjusting at first, but does not hold back from the excellence this story gives us.
Art 10/10- This was animated in 1998 by Sunrise and they did phenomenal. Everything looks great, including the unique character designs as well and how well they match each
                  character. The art is simply the definition of a 90s classic when you watch it. 
Sound 10/10- If there is one thing Cowboy Bebop is most noted for it is its sound. Cowboy Bebop has this western influence inside of its soundtrack that is perfectly represented in the show. The Opening and Ending remain some of my favorite in anime. This is one of the anime's where the English Dub is equal if not better than the original in japanese. I personally watched in Dub and was amazed by how well the voice acting is done especially Steve Blum's take on Spike Spiegel which is nothing short of a masterpiece.
Characters 10/10- Cowboy Bebop has some of the best written characters among its cast, with many characters being crucial to the story and each having a backstory that adds to that character and how they act. Without going into too much detail, to keep this review spoiler-free Cowboy Bebop shows how phenomenal and how attached you can get to characters in the span of 26 episodes.
Enjoyment 9/10- Cowboy Bebop is a very enjoyable series and is thought of to be a gateway for new anime watchers, due to its episodic and western influence. I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop and it will definitely etch itself in my memory as one of my favorites of all-time. It is simply an anime, that is non-forgettable and will continue to remain a classic for years to come.
Overall Rating- 10/10",10,camdenconner,
1,"
                From the energetic jazz-filled opening to the melancholic ""see you space cowboy"" at the end of each episode, cowboy bebop never fails to invoke excitement and sadness respectively as each episode begins and ultimately ends. The soundtrack is amazing by itself and can be talked about for hours on end but when used as a support to the immersive world and characters shown to us throughout the series it all comes together as a masterpiece. 
The story consists of a group of bounty hunters and their journey throughout the galaxy together. It sounds very simple and in many cases, it is because it follows the
                  ""catch a new criminal per episode"" formula but it does it well with its good pacing and brilliant short stories that expand the world of cowboy bebop without feeling overwhelming or overbearing with context dumps.
The crew of the spaceship bebop are quirky and are all vastly different from one another but also seem connected from a silent bond of companionship, mutual appreciation and respect for one another which is a very refreshing take of a good dichotomy that isn't only just arguments and conflicting personality clashes. Each episode can involve comedy, action and sometimes even mystery but the most memorable moments are when the vulnerabilities of the cast are revealed. Their different methods of coping and reacting to each of these opened scars are so human that they can't be told apart from just being characters written from a script. Its a story about running, fighting and dealing with life, the coat of sugar replaced with a more mature and realistic view of a sci-fi world. 
The art style is very retro and stands out in comparison to generic art styles of most seasonal anime of 2019 (with some exceptions*). It looks unique, beautiful and in my opinion, very fitting of the sci-fi dystopian world filled to the brim with love and smooth jazz. Animations are a visual treat with hand to hand fight scenes, shootouts and dogfights that all look amazing and are coloured amazingly. 
Overall Cowboy Bebop is a beautiful series for those that want to watch a good story unfold and a good journey that would leave you wanting more.

*megalo box tries to recreate the retro art look and also captures the tone with its art style brilliantly",10,midjune,

                Cowboy Bebop is a collection of passable episodic action adventures that gets elevated by audiovisual excellence and stylish directing. Having seen a lot of action adventures, the individual stories themselves are nothing special and the characters, though cool at their base, are too stiff to contribute much chemistry to spice up the adventures. As an action adventure, Cowboy Bebop cannot compete with the sheer fun factor of Justice League or Clone Wars or Lupin III. 
In general, although it's better to be understated than to tell too much, I couldn't discern much character development, as you can scramble the episodes and not notice a difference
                  in the characters themselves and their interactions with the other members of the crew. I'm open to opposing thoughts on this, but I don't think it's a coincidence that this problem shows up in Samurai Champloo as well. The only thing that changes is that the characters become slightly more tolerant towards each other. Even so, any bonds they share are quickly torn when they each are so ready to abandon the crew. 
SPOILERS
Spike straight up disregards his partnership with Jet and leaves on at least two different occasions for selfish reasons. I get that he's the lone wolf, stubborn type, but still, he won't budge an inch for anyone else when his own interests conflict with the crew's. When Faye tells him not to leave, he doesn't give a damn and walks off. Speaking of Faye, there's no reason shown for why she decides to join up with the crew again after she runs away. Implicitly, it's because of what Gren said to her, but she also doesn't apologize for leaving the crew out to dry. In addition, Jet was only looking for the money she stole and picked her up by coincidence. I get that Cowboy Bebop's style is very macho and people don't talk about their feelings aloud, preferring to leave things unsaid, but at a certain point you need to give me something to hold onto. OK, even if we accept that resolution, later Faye doesn't waste a second high tailing the hell out of the Bebop when she thinks she's found her family, only to come crawling back because the crew is all she has left. I can understand that Faye is selfish and she would leave a second time, but it's the way she left--- she didn't even look back. That doesn't sound like a strong relationship to me. She's just desperate and looking for a home. The same thing goes with Ed. She just gets up and leaves with Ein one day without even bothering to inform the crew face to face. Just like in Samurai Champloo, Watanabe doesn't seem to want his characters to get too close to one another and it baffles me.
ENDSPOILERS
It's a shame, because many of the episodes that I'm lukewarm towards could be substantially improved with great character banter and having the events of the episode actually change the characters, even incrementally. Instead, most of the time the characters work on separate jobs, rarely working together as a team. They talk to each other like coworkers, not as friends, which is fine in the beginning, but not when you're 20 episodes in. It's not really that big of a problem since Watanabe is so good at crafting interesting, charismatic, and yet deeply human characters that feel alive on the screen. The characters are well designed enough that they can get through 26 episodes without much change or bonding, but the show could've been so much better if they didn't just do that. Much of the time Spike does the field work, Faye's doing something else, Jet's the intel guy, and Ed is off doing her own hacking stuff. 
It gets much worse if you watch the dub of Lupin III and realize that Cowboy Bebop's cast is just a pale version of Lupin III's, and the excuse that the characters are stiff with one another because they're not the type to change doesn't fly anymore. Selfish femme fatale with commitment issues? Fujiko pulls that off with much more charisma, sex appeal, and chemistry with men. Straightlaced, stable beard guy? Jigen's the man. Spike doesn't really have a direct analog, as he's nowhere near as silly as Lupin, but the fact remains that the collective chemistry in Lupin III far surpasses that of Cowboy Bebop. Don't believe me? You can just look up the ""best of Lupin III dub"" on Youtube. 
Yeah, it's a nostalgic show about broken people wandering aimlessly in space, but it seems content in reveling in the cool factor of this state rather than exploring the ways their bonds with each other change them (it does, but it's rather weak, as I mentioned before) or how they try to amend that brokenness. When the ending comes, it feels like Cowboy Bebop just decided to end after a series of fun adventures, rather than as a culmination of events that incrementally lead up to the choices that the characters make to bring about that end. You can say that the characters and ideas are developed around the concept of the past, which is valid, but it seems to me that all of it amounts to, “You can’t forget the past, so you’re going to have to carry that weight.” I don’t see how that’s insightful, as obviously your past is going to weigh on you and it’s impossible to completely forget it and move on. The main problem is that simply talking about the past in general is superficial. People's pasts are different and what matters is exactly what about their unique past the keeps them from moving forward? The question for me is, how do we reconcile with our pasts without letting it drag us down? The answer to this question is unique to each individual and their personal struggles, and it isn't as simple as, ""just move on"".  With Cowboy Bebop, I was looking for the crew to find new purpose, form a new family, and do something new with their lives. Jet seems to be the only character who has closure on his past because he engages with the reasons for how things turned out the way they did. 
SPOILERS
Of course, Spike breaks that family in an attempt to confront his past, which made no sense to me. Spike may be the coolest animated character ever, and effortlessly so, but his edgy death wish attitude is not cool. ""I'm not going to die. I'm going to find out if I'm really alive."" *Proceeds to go off to die*. It's alright for a character to have this attitude, as Spike has good reason to. The crux of the problem is that I don’t understand how going back and killing a bunch of mobsters and dying because of it provides any type of emotional catharsis. That’s not confronting your past. Confronting your past would be correcting the mistake you made by not repeating it. You can argue Vicious’s rise of power was Spike’s fault and that Spike is going back to prevent Vicious from taking any more lives, but Spike seems to kill Vicious as a symbolic gesture. Dude, you just repeated the same self destructive, violent behavior that messed up your past in the first place. Perhaps that’s the point, that Spike couldn’t move on, but that’s not confronting the past and that's not saying anything more substantial either. 
ENDSPOILERS
The other half of the problem is that your immersion in Cowboy Bebop is highly dependent on whether or not you resonate with its nostalgic longing for the past. I don't. I always look towards the future. If you gave me the chance to go back to my childhood or high school or college, I wouldn't take it because I'm always trying to build on what came before, so that every day I'm a better person than I was before. Thus, when I see the crew of Cowboy Bebop with all the freedom in the world and long lives ahead of them, I don't understand their unwillingness to look at new possibilities. This wouldn't be a problem if the show did a better job of making me understand why exactly they have trouble letting go instead of talking about the past in general. Spike has trouble letting go of two things: 1) Julia 2) his time in a crime syndicate. It's easy for anyone to understand how hard it is to move on from a loved one, but still, the relationship between Julia and Spike is barely shown and when Julia does show up, she has a pretty boring personality. As for the gang activity, is it that Spike has trouble leaving behind his gangster ways? Does he miss the brotherhood of the gang? Does he need the adrenaline? It's never entirely clear, so it's harder for me to comprehend why this good-looking, talented 23 year old with no laws governing him doesn't go and enjoy his life. It's the same story with Faye's past. If I got a look into her touching relationships with her family and friends, it would be much easier for me to understand why she wants to go back to that so badly because I too, would be feeling her attachment. Whereas in her current situation, I see that Faye is lucky enough to find three other people that give her a place to stay, a job to work, and company, which is a damn good deal for a person who just woke up with nothing left. If the show did go down this more specific role, it would also allow a scene where Spike or Jet inadvertently do a specific gesture for Faye that her family once did, cementing the ragtag family dynamic in a much stronger way that also helps Faye cope with her past in a specific manner. Instead, her attachment to a place of belonging or her past is hard to understand because she has amnesia. Jet, as I mentioned, gets the best treatment in that I readily understand his pain from his girlfriend leaving him and he gets to throw away his broken watch. At the same time, just like with Spike, the discussion around his attachment to his police days is muddy. Jet is deadset in his methods, straightlaced, and carries the image of a dog who never lets go. This is the mentality that gets him shot and betrayed, which he finds out later. Ok, but now you're retired and free to do whatever you want? In what way are you being tied down by your past? Is it that your straightlaced attitude and stubborness still leads to problems in your life? Well you at least dealt with your commanding nature in Waltz for Zizi already. You find out your partner betrayed you. It's never shown what kind of impact this has on Jet's straightlaced dog persona. Having a past that defines and weighs on a character is basic character writing. The rest of the work has to deal with the specifics of each past instead of settling for a useless general statement of ""the character can't move on from the past"" or ""the character decided to move on"". 
The Bourne series does this past thing a whole lot better in terms of having a past that you can't escape, because it literally has the CIA constantly try to kill Bourne despite his attempts to start a new life. Mind you, Bourne has no memories just like Faye, and he's been a gun toting martial artist just like Spike. You see Bourne specifically struggle with resisting the programming the CIA gave him and struggle to decide whether or not to kill someone. On JJ Redick's podcast recently, former NBA MVP Steve Nash talked about how hard it was to accept that his days in the NBA were over despite his desperate attempts to keep himself in the game. He then makes peace with it by acknowledging that he has had a good career, and that he can transfer his competitive spirit into other areas in life. For him, letting go of the past was letting go of the spirit of competition and the support from the fans. Satoshi Kon's short film Magnetic Rose deals with an opera singer stuck in the past of her glory days. We clearly understand that she misses performing and the fame that comes with it and that's why she can't let go. The answer to the question of the past is always ""you have to make your peace with it and move on"". That's kind of a non-statement. The duty of shows that choose to tackle the topic is to explore how exactly this is done on an individual level (and not simply have a character decide to move on abruptly like Ed). Or if people keep falling into a cycle, still explore attempts to move on rather than just drifting around and then pinpoint the factors that counter these attempts to move on. Because despite what the show suggests, the past is not always a weight. It is certainly not for me at this point. A show can take the opposite approach and talk about the past lovingly as fond memories, like Kaiba. 
All in all, why am I even bothering to write so much about this issue? If I hadn't known any better, I would've just said that Cowboy Bebop is a good to great action adventure with a lot of style and a sprinkling of brokenness and themes about the past to add some dimension the characters carrying out those fun action adventures. There's a simple message that's repeated for 26 episodes. The thing is, Samurai Champloo is pretty much a mirror image of Cowboy Bebop and you don't see people proclaiming the same things about Samurai Champloo as they do about Cowboy Bebop. Champloo literally has characters doing suicidal things to find out they're really alive TWICE in the same episode. At that point I decided that Watanabe really doesn't have anything more to say beyond ""people can't let go of their past so they're stuck in a state of limbo"" and my feelings about Cowboy Bebop weren't a fluke. And just like Cowboy Bebop, characters will go through events and things from their past and it doesn't change them at all. Sure, it fleshes them out, but you don't even get to hear their thoughts on it. Later in Samurai Champloo, another character must let go her past by letting of of her hope that her son is alive, but this one moment is more powerful to me than Spike's and Faye's stories. 
There's a case to be made that Bebop is really about simply showing how people repeat themselves and can't move on from their old habits, and that's fine but I don't know, maybe I'm just not old enough to connect emotionally with it. 
It looks like I'm nitpicking Cowboy Bebop, but in an episodic series, you really have to nail every single minute, and as for its substance, it failed to arouse emotion or resonate with me. I think its massive hype also affected my opinion, as I might have rated it higher if I just went in not knowing anything. Is it a masterpiece? Yes, if you buy into its message about the past. I don’t, but perhaps that will change as I get older. Still, it’s not just a legendary anime--- it’s a legendary work of storytelling in general.",8,Recynon,

                The first time I saw this anime, I was in high school. By chance, the third episode was the one that I saw first, and I don't think that if I had started from the beginning, this show would have had as much of an impact on me as it did. I may not even have continued to watch. But for angsty little me, I was amazed by that episode. I had found an idol in the cool woman with no past, Faye Valentine.
I continued to watch the show, over and over again (as it met with a lot of success and was aired for
                  a number of years), and I fell in love with it completely.
The characters in this show are amazingly done. They are all very interesting, and you want to know more about them. They have flaws and problems, and sometimes they get on your nerves, just like ordinary people. They pass in and out of your life, just like ordinary people, too.
The music is amazing as well.
It feels as though there really isn't much that I could say that hasn't already been said numerous times before, and by far more eloquent people than I am. This is one of my favorite anime shows, and it is a classic for good reason. It is a very well-made anime.
If you are curious, and haven't seen it yet, go for it! Chances are very good that even if you don't love it, it will entertain you as it has so many others. Both subtitled and dubbed versions are wonderful. I would recommend the dubbed (english) version, simply because it's so well-done, and you will be able to enjoy the show more without having to read the subtitles.",10,paintpixie,

                Reviews by me go by ""Keep it simple."" rule so here it is:
Cowboy bebop is an excellen anime, no doub about that. But what makes it better than the others? Is it the uniqueness of the cahracters or the originality of the style? Or is it by a chance the flow of plot which is subtly injected into an episodic anime?
All those above are for sure reasons why it is better than the others, but the main reason is actually quite simple: Every time you see the typical
""See you space cowboy...""
at the end of each episode you just feel the urge to watch the next
                  one.
To make a long story short :) It is awesome and when it ends u will still want some more :)
Re-watch: (this is just subjective) Every time I re-watch the anime I have a feeling like I've found something new about the cahracters or the plot... What a strange feeling that is, I can't describe.",10,Alexius321,

                Cowboy Bebop is my favourite anime ever created.I remember the first time I saw it, it was airing on a channel called AnimeCentral in the UK. I was just flicking through channels at the dead of night, as soon as I landed on the channel I was blown away by the sheer brilliance of the soundtrack combining with the animation so perfectly.From that day on I watched it every night, religiously.This show was the whole reason I got into anime.
STORY (10)
Cowboy bebop is an episodic anime with a general plot underlying the whole series.The individual episodes have great stories within in them and are all
                  very different form each other and will keep you entertained.The underlying plot is superb, although there are not many episodes that are part of the main plot the story is told brilliantly.You really feel for the characters and personally the end was one of the saddest moments I have ever witnessed.
MUSIC(10)
Now, the music of Cowboy Bebop is still the best music you will hear in an anime.The music itself is fantastic but not only that, it goes perfectly with animation and really draws out the emotion from your very soul.Without the music Cowboy Bebop wouldn't be considered the legend that it is today.
CHARACTERS(10)
Characters much like the rest of the show are executed fantastically.Each of the characters has their own unique personality and background.They are all likeable, have there own storyline and character development.Cowboy Bebop uses the episodic nature of the show to show all the lives of the people and what they have been through and lets you get to really know the character.
ART(10)
The art is absolutely fantastic. Due to its darker colours and faded looks it adds to the general theme of the show as well adds to the more sombre mood of the show.(I don't really know much more about art and this is my first review so forgive me if that bit was a tad short)
Overall(10)
This anime is absolutely fantastic and you don't even have to like anime to like Cowboy Bebop as it crosses the boarder into a whole different realm where all the great anime belong and can be appriciated by anyone.This anime is an essential watch for anyone and especially anime fans.This anime will always, personally, be considered the best ever made. But I'm hoping there will be an anime to prove me wrong.But don't forget once you finish this anime You're Gonna Carry That Weight.",10,EnjoyTheSilence,

                I apoligize for writing another review for this show on a different account, but I love writing reviews for this show and decided to write a more detailed one. Well, here we go.
Cowboy Bebop is probabaly one of the best anime shows on Earth and I'll tell you why. The artwork is amazing and so is the animation and is good for old-schoolers to enjoy. The animation makes you feel like you're back in the 70s along with the music. It's jazzy and has its blues from the 50s-60s I think.
Story:
The story focuses on a duo of bossy bounty hunters who happen to be poor
                  dogs. They need money so this guy named Jet (who's the owner of the ship) leads a man named Spike to help out to get some cash. They soon come across three other bounties and their names are Faye Valentine, the bossy gambler, Radical Edward, the playful but mischevious teen, and Ein, the smart and intelligent dog. Soon, their adventures begin... into an amazing one. I can't spoil the ending, but it does get funny every once in a while... it has its drama, comedy, romance, action and thriller, but is also very painful at the end... which most crybabies can't handle.
Sound:
I loved the jazzy music and blues in this. Especially with the Tank! opening or the Space Lion songs... both of these songs rocked and are one of my favorites in Cowboy Bebop. I also liked ""Blues"" too. And let me introduce the amazing voice actors they picked... Steven Jay Blum and Wendee Lee both did a great job with their characters and I thought that they had the best voices to ever exist in dubbed anime. At first, I never liked to watch anime dubbed, but now I'd want to watch it in subtitles except for Cowboy bebop, the voices really fit the characters' moods and attitudes and I'm very happy for the creator who did it. It was better than the Japanese subtitles... which were a lot better in dialouge because you could understand that some of the characters are moody every once in a while.
Characters:
Oh my gosh! My favorite is definietely Spike... he's my all-time favorite. And I loved Faye too... of course I didn't really care for her in the beginning, but now she seems like the funniest anime character ever behind Spike Spiegel. I also loved Ed too, who I'd say was pretty annoying at times, but I still loved her. Spike had his passion... he's quite mischevious and so is Faye who was pretty naughty, bossy and tomboyish while Ed is simply just onrery. Nothing to say about Jet but he was cool I guess. Ein was adorable!
Animation:
The animation seemd to match what the future may be like including the artwork. Yeah, I know it may be a little jumpier than most anime are, but it is pretty cool and I loved how they drew in the artwork for what how Mars, Jupiter or Asteriod would look like.
Enjoyment:
I guess I wasn't really enthused with the anime the first few episodes, but on Honky Tonk Woman, it got interesting... I didn't really like Gateway Shuffle very much, but Ballad of Fallen Angels made me want to watch the whole thing. There are very unique episodes such as Stray Dog Strut where Ein comes in and they have to track down a puppy, Honky Tonk Woman where they go to try to get money on gambling but coincendentally permitted a woman to join the team who is actually a bounty, Gateway Shuffle where they capture a bounty who is fond of her son, Sympathy for the Devil where Spike has to help this senior kid-looking guy turn into a senior so that he could die and many more. My favorite episode would have to be Brain Scratch, but Toys in the Attic where the Bebop was filled with plutonium was interesting too and then I enjoyed the series mainly the whole way through even though there were some episodes that weren't my cup of tea or were just nothing special.
Overall: A Great series to watch for the old-schoolers and definetely for anybody who doesn't watch anime... they could warm-up with a very good start on Cowboy Bebop unless they've seen a couple.",10,Agnes_2,

                Now I had put off watching cowboy bebop for a LONG time.  My friend had talked to me about it, and I had sorta just taken a glance and put it to the side.  I finally picked it up after almost 7? months and I am so happy that I did.
Story:  Initially, I found the story to be somewhat slow and uninteresting.  However, as I progressed, I slowly fell in love with the episode-by-episode sort of style that Cowboy Bebop took on.  Each episode was a different plot.  However, what truly makes the story good is the characters. 
                  Each episode would simply not be complete without the funky music and personable characters that make the show so fun to watch.  The plots themselves are only brought to life because of the amazing backing.
Art:  Not much to say here except that I really enjoy the art.  The color palette is so fitting and it really just ties the show together so well.
Sound:  Genuinely one of the best soundtracks ever.  Each song is so unique and fits so well with the show.  I listen to the music in my free time, often when I'm cleaning (my favorites are Cats on Mars and Wo Qui Non Coin :)).  The opening is so different than the usual, yet it just fits so well!  I wish I could better express how much I enjoy the soundtrack and how great it is, but I really can't.
Character:  Like I said before, it's really the characters that bring the show to life.  The crew consists of Spike, Jet, Faye, and Ed.  Each episode is so interesting simply because they make it so enjoyable to watch!  My personal favorite was Ed, who was a silly and fun side character,  When she left, I was somewhat suprised to feel myself shed some tears.  
Overall, I really enjoyed this show, and it's one of my favorites for sure.  Hell, I rewatch it so often whenever I'm feeling down (particularly episode 17).  I highly recommend this show.",10,rrey,

                [STORY: 7/10]
I'll say that the overall story is good, but what holds it back is its tendency to be cliché and even boring at times. A couple of episodes are completely irrelevant to the main story, and with only twenty-six episodes and a movie to portray this story, it can get annoying, as those slots could've been used to better develop the characters or feature a way more interesting adventure.
[ART: 10/10]
The art for this show is older and very pleasing to the eye. Alot of the character design and set pieces are very unique and creative, putting together an atmosphere that is epic in scope
                  and beautiful to look at.
[SOUND: 10/10]
The show is known for its iconic soundtrack containing heavy jazz influence and it really sets the style and mood for the show. The music fits the designated scenes and is very pleasant to listen to. The voice actors are very good and give their characters life, and I've heard the dub is just as good as the sub, which is a rare occurrence. 
[CHARACTERS: 6/10]
There are some very interesting (albeit not all very original) characters that occupy the main cast of this show. The main downside is a lack of character development throughout. Relationships are built, but unless it's a major part of the story, mostly nothing changes. Almost each and every episode or set of episodes follows a separate adventure that could be watched in any order and it wouldn't make much difference. This isn't inherently bad, but for the characters we grow to care for, we want to see them grow and change, finding out who they are and why they do what they do. Sadly, we just don't get enough of that here.
[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 7/10]
Alot of people won't dare to criticize this show, either because it was their introduction to the medium or they are afraid of the backlash that comes with this show's popularity here. I would say I enjoyed my time watching this series, but it isn't mind-blowing or game-changing for me. I do appreciate the unique atmosphere, characters, and story when it's good, but the way the show is done, it just falls short too much to warrant anything above a seven.",7,risinglazarus,

                A lot of people think Cowboy Bebop is the greatest anime ever made. There is quite a simple reason why that is, and that's because it's almost objectively true. Even if you don't agree with that, which some of you might after completing the show, it's a fact that Cowboy Bebop with all its iconic-ness and themes has become one of the most influential pieces of not only Japanese visual media, but even worldwide. I will keep this as short as possible, and will refrain from using any spoilers (except for vague descriptions of the general themes, and opinions/emotions regarding events that happen late in
                  the series. I WILL NOT describe those events in any way, shape or form, so be calm). This is my first review, so feedback would be appreciated.
STORY - 8/10
For promotional purposes, the series' creative director Shinichiro Watanabe said in the initial presentation that Cowboy Bebop would be ""A new genre unto itself"". Why he said so becomes apparent to anyone that watches the series past episode 1, where it becomes apparent that the show really can't be categorised under a single genre. It pulls inspiration from so many different visual media that it almost literally becomes a new genre. It has themes from genres like western, science-fiction, crime, mafia, romance, post-apocalyptic, even a bit of horror, and the list goes on. There even are a few homages to popular western media (like one that I especially adored somewhere in the middle of the series, which I won't spoil, but it has a hilarious conclusion). Anyway, all I'm saying is, it will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and most important of all, it will make you watch the series to the end.
 The plot takes place in the late 21st century, with technology being as futuristic as you would expect; Space ships, planetary colonisation, and, of course, bounty-hunters. The main character Spike Spiegel is one of those bounty-hunters with an unknown past (which becomes more clear in later episodes). He is joined by his friend Jet, an ex-cop who lost his arm in an accident, years ago. They both go hunt bounties each episode, which usually ends up in them receiving no money at all.
The episodes are set up in a 'monster-of-the-week' style chronology, with overarching plot-lines occasionally bopping their head in to make the viewer remember they were there in the first place. This type of storytelling really has a lot of downsides, and is mainly the reason why I didn't give the story a 9/10. If you don't know what 'monster-of-the-week' means, it means that every episode is basically its own arc of the story, with new characters (aside from the main cast) coming in every episode. The big downside is that any buildup made in the previous arc is usually mostly forgotten by the time the next arc starts (this happens a few times later in). However, I'm not saying it is all bad. Because Cowboy Bebop has literally a bazillion different genres and themes, it's easier for the storywriters to address one or more themes per episode, instead of making it a huge clusterfuck of themes and ideas in one giant 24-episode plot. All-in-all, I think it could have been done better, but it would be really difficult.
ART - 9/10
I can't say much about the art except that it was pretty good. The fights are well-choreographed, the animation is smooth, however, it being such an old anime kind of has its downsides which may be hard to get used to. For example, the CG in some episodes are really outdated and practically destroy the immersion, but thankfully the CG is used extremely rarely. Most scenes are very well-made and even ahead of its time at some points. It really holds up well (aside from the CG).
SOUND - 10/10
Oh lawd, the music.
I can safely say that Cowboy Bebop (especially the movie) has the best anime soundtrack ever made. Like the series itself, it really is a mix of all kinds of genres. One episode you may be listening to a wonderfully composed vocal track, and the next episode you might be listening to a piece of hard rock. It not only enhances the thrill, or the enjoyment of certain scenes, it enhances any kind of scene. Dramatic, comedic, action-packed, silly, happy, sad, you name it. Yoko Kanno is by all means an amazing composer, and she even outdid herself. I can't even describe the feelings I felt when I first heard some of these amazingly well-done tracks, and it really is an experience I probably have only felt with maybe a handful of other anime. To round this segment up, Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack is amazing, and you should NOT listen to any tracks before watching the series, as it's kind of spoiler-y.
As an extra, I can't really say much about the original Japanese dubs, as I'm not Japanese, but I can certainly say that the English dub is incredibly well done, and if you aren't Japanese, I advise you to watch the dub instead of the sub.
CHARACTER - 9/10
Ah, the 90s. Character archetypes were still in their infancy, new archetypes were made up everywhere. It was all pioneering. This series might not have the most original characters ever made, but they certainly have amazing backstories. In a way, the character-building might have both gained and lost some of its values because of the 'monster-of-the-week' format. It gained some since every single backstory is bloody beautiful, and the format condenses much more character backstories into a shorter timeframe. On the downside, this makes it so the character buildup feels slightly rushed sometimes, and, like I said in the STORY segment, sometimes these buildups are just completely forgotten by the next episode. For example, there's one episode late in the anime where one of the main cast's characters who has amnesia basically finds out their past, with a terribly sad/dramatic ending to the episode. What, do you expect the drama to go on the next episode? Nope, just back to bounty-hunting with a new bounty to hunt. I might be spoiling things a bit here, but it's just a heads-up.
ENJOYMENT - 10/10
Personal enjoyment is probably the biggest factor in the end-score, which is a good thing for Cowboy Bebop because I enjoyed every last second of it. I can't really explain why. The anime is extremely enjoyable, there.
OVERALL - 9/10
Does Cowboy Bebop deserve to be engraved in culture forever? Yes. Yes it does. You honestly do yourself a disservice if you don't watch this before your 10th anime. Cowboy Bebop is a classic of anime, and visual media as a whole. The story is amazing and original, the art is good, and still holds up now, the sound is fucking amazing, the characters are interesting, and the series is enjoyable. What more do you want? A hyper-intelligent space-corgi? Oh, wait...",9,somguy9,

                Cowboy Bebop is outstanding in every way. The only aspect it fell even a little short on was characters, but it was practically unnoticeable. The premise is a fantasy that I'm sure many people had wished were real since the discovery of other planets. The premise of humanity colonizing other planets in the solar system and bounty hunters roam the seas of space to catch criminals opens itself to a plentiful amount of settings to place your characters. Paired with it's stunning art that'll be sure to hold up forever, the plot and setting never cease to amaze the eyes. The sound in this show
                  is astounding. With it's classic opening, Tank, and it's jazzy soundtrack. It's simply like candy for the ears. Now here's what I was saying before on falling flat somewhere. The characters in this show don't go as far as they could've. But that doesn't mean that they aren't still great. They're still charming, lovable, and leave an emotional attachment even after finishing watching. This sets up one specific part of the show that still hangs with me and will continue to hang with me as long as I remember the name ""Cowboy Bebop."" This'll contain a spoiler, but i'm not sure how anyone hasn't finished Cowboy Bebop yet or had this spoiled for them yet. Skip to this 
""--"" mark for when the spoiler ends. My favorite and at the same time least favorite part of this show is when Spike dies. His death is set up all too perfectly that I hate whoever sat down and wrote it. The entire show made us become attached to Spike to the point that I even felt like he was a close friend. So when he passed in the ending, it dug deep. It does it even better with how it's timed too. With a couple episodes of build up to Spike confronting his past. It slowly sinks into you that Spike is not going to come back. The characters in the show also slowly come to terms with this as well as they say their last goodbyes to Spike when they never wanted to part in the first place. Everyone that knew Spike(except Ed and Ein) know that someone they never thought they'd become close with is leaving in such a cruel way. Then to top it all off, the show ends on a shot of Spike's smile as he lies on the ground lifeless with the final words appearing on the screen. ""You're gonna carry that weight"" Powerful words that'll stick forever. -- Cowboy Bebop is a ride of fun, action, and lovable characters. It honestly does deserve it's crown that the fans gave it. There isn't a single person who shouldn't watch this show, even if they somehow don't like it. This show rightfully deserves a 10. That's about it. Until next time, see you space cowboy.",10,Melonsoda1,

                The basic premise and presentation are evocative of Whedon-san's Firefly, right down to the stand-alone nature of many of the episodes and the lamentable yet appropriate brevity of the series' as a whole. Interactions between the characters are always lively and engaging, and no part of an episode is ever wasted. Everything, even the music, works together to tell the stories of the bounties and the cowboys alike, each episode dovetailing to form a richly populated universe that serves as the stage for the members of the Bebop in their struggles to come to terms with their pasts, their comrades, and their woefully meager cash

                A modest success in it's home country that became a bigger hit once it aired on Adult Swim in 2001, Watanabe's jazz-infused space western has become one of anime's most enduring classics and for good reason. To a lot of people in the early 2000s, CB was their gateway anime and it's by far one of the most accessible titles due to the fact that it almost feels tailor-made for western audiences given how the show heavily draws from westerns, john woo action flicks, and film noir. 
Despite being mostly episodic in nature with the over-arching story being relatively thin (only 5 ep touch on
                  the Spike vs. Vicious plot), CB manages to stay engaging throughout due to it's intoxicating atmosphere, immersive world-building, layered characters, light-hearted comedy and memorable scenarios. Plenty of my favorite anime episodes ever are in CB (Ex. Ballad of Fallen Angels, Sympathy for the Devil, Ganymede Elegy, Jupiter Jazz). CB also has one of the greatest and most satisfying endings to any show ever. 
The English dub by Animaze is also deserving of all the praise it gets as one of the greatest dubs of all time with Steve Blum, Beau Billingslea, Wendee Lee and Melissa Fahn delivering iconic performances. Not a single voice sounds out of place and the line deliveries sound so natural. Probably my personal favorite of the show's guest stars was Daran Norris as Andy von de Oniyate, who is a complete riot! 
When a dub is so good that even the most hardened sub-purists would tell you to watch the show in English first before the Japanese, then you know it's something truly special. 
While I have nothing but love for CB, there are a couple of flaws that prevent me from giving it a perfect score. Given it's episodic nature, inevitably there are going to be episodes that are better than others. Despite containing plenty of good to even great episodes, there are a couple stories that come out average (Ex. Bohemian Rhapsody) and episode 21 (Boogie Woogie Feng Shui) is a straight-up stinker. It also would have been nice if the over-arching plot episodes were more evenly spread out throughout the show's run. 
There is also a part of me that wishes the show utilized Ed more often in the plots. I love Ed and her surreal comic antics never fail to put a smile on my face, but we rarely get to see her put her computer hacking skills to good use. 
One character that I felt could have used more development was Vicious. We never get much of a glimpse of what Spike and Vicious' relationship was like in the past. Vicious also does not have much of personality and thus feels more like a force of nature than a fully-fleshed out character. Maybe the whole force of nature thing was the point but nonetheless, Vicious always came off as one of the show's less interesting elements. 
Despite some of these minor issues, I still come back to CB often and watch the series at least once every year. There is a lot of re-watch value due to it's subtle deep existential themes and well-crafted stories.",9,Norris_Packard,

                It's the very definition of anime for me, and from what it seems a classic for many. It oozes class and a great degree of style. The European and American influences may be the reason why I consider it so, but nevertheless, it's a great overall package. Another point that sticks out is the great jazz, blues and soul soundtrack - does not quite sound obvious at all for an anime set in the year 2071 on the planet Mars, does it?

Next episode: I don't give a shit because there is nothing to look forward to in this anime, the story I kid you not actually made me fall asleep. The characters were so undeveloped I didn't cry when any of them died,

The fact that I even got through this entire anime is a miracle, I usually get swayed by public opinion alot, like for example if an anime gets really high ratings and I watch it, I would give it a rating higher than I thought it was.

                Very rarely can I give an anime an across the board 10/10 rating. Cowboy Bebop is deserving of such high regard. Followin Spike Spiegel and his crew of bounty hunters about the Cowboy Bebop in a futuristic setting, this anime has a unique feel. It is a mix of the wonder of science fiction, the mystery of classic anime, and that bit of adventure found in many American shows. Yoko Kanno's composition for the soundtrack includes majorly jazz style music, a style not commonly found in anime. Though each episode is its own story, the underlying arc that links it all together leaves the watcher
                  longing to see more. The unexpected ending gives a feeling of completion but still leaves that sliver of a possibility for the story to continue. 
Cowboy Bebop is very similar to the American Scifi show Firefly and it quite likely a source of inspiration for it. Watching Cowboy Bebop is a blast. At times it will put you at the edge of your seat in anticipation and at other points falling to the floor in laughter. Definately a classic masterpiece.",10,starflower,

                This is one of those classic Anime series that will always be fresh in people’s minds even if it gets older and older.
I loved it a lot.
When I watched Cowboy Bebop first, I was pretty excited given the fact that I had heard a lot of positive reviews about this.
Though it is just 26 episodes, halfway through the show, I started to feel a bit bored.
This was because the story didn’t follow the main storyline. This series is unique because it is an episodic one. That means, the episodes featured individual stories with different adventures.
But I made myself watch it and boy! It was a
                  great decision to continue watching this greatness.
Not to get you excited but the ending of this show is just mind-boggling!!

                Space cowboys be like. Before watching this I had gotten the ""bebop hype"" as I'd like to call it. I had asked some friends before hand of what they thought about it and should I watch it. I wasn't too much ready for this anime, expecting  some form of complex plot or something of the sort. But I was wrong. Instead, I just got prices of the crazy life of Spike and Jet. The episodes don't have any real chronological order, except for the first few episodes, and that what I like about it. The fights scenes paired with the art style, are what
                  really sparked my interest though. Don't even get me started on the fight scenes. Although they are quite rare in the anime, they show real combat that involves the environment quite a lot. I also enjoyed watching the side main characters get involved with Spike and Jet's adventures as well. I'd highly recommend this anime for perhaps new comers and for people who just wanna watch something not too mind boggling.",10,Bamhurglar,

                The Positive Side:  Cowboy Bebop was the first anime I could really get into as an adult, and its maturity remains one of the things that sets it apart from most popular anime of its time.  After watching hokey kids’ stuff like Pokémon and the cheesy, attack-name-screaming, adolescent violence of Dragon Ball Z, I was a little surprised to find an anime I could actually take seriously.  Despite it being science fiction, Cowboy Bebop’s setting feels both believable and extremely original.  The smokey, ill-lit bars and gray, rain-washed city-streets could have been pulled straight out of a crime noir film, and
                  there’s a joy in watching hi-tech innovations like space-ships and computer hackers interact with mafia hierarchies and drug deal plots.
Despite hailing from the era of pre-digital animation, Cowboy Bebop’s art is superb.  The character designs are striking and memorable, and there’s just enough color to offset the generally somber backgrounds.  The fight scenes are particularly wonderful, and Spike’s martial arts motto, “Be like water,” translates into action that is both fluid and visceral.
As for the music… well, just about the entire soundtrack is composed by Yoko freakin’ Kanno, perhaps the greatest musical talent in the anime industry.  The Seatbelts deliver a blend of jazz, blues and rock that moves from melancholy to energetic and back in perfect sync with the story.  The lyrics are pretty terrific on tracks that have them, so it’s worth putting an ear to the OST.
The character development is all-around great.  Our protagonist, Spike Spiegel, has more than enough casually badass attitude and ass-whupping ability to serve as an escapist character, but also has just enough brooding moments that you can feel how his past has scarred him.  Jet is an ideal foil, constantly fretting and worrying over Spike’s well-being like a surrogate father while insisting that he doesn’t care what happens to Spike if he leaves.  Faye serves as wild-card, shifting femme fatale to ally at the drop of a hat, constantly keeping the audience guessing as to where her loyalties lie, or if they even exist.  Ed is a consistently bubbly comic relief, but also contributes to the team through her incredible hacking abilities.  Even minor characters who are only present for an episode or two gleam with life and intrigue.
The show gives us a good look at how people struggle against their own pasts.  There are plenty of other themes—vengeance, war, and ambition—but at its heart, this is a story about the struggles between past and future, a theme captured by the anachronistic setting as well as by the struggles of our intrepid bounty hunters.
The Negative Side: Where does Cowboy Bebop come up short?  Well… uh… it isn’t the cure for cancer, nor will it help you lose 20 pounds in 30 days.
Joking aside, this anime is about as close to perfect as they come.  Some fans are put off by the plot structure, which is far more episodic than most anime, but every episode is capable of standing on its own, so it really doesn’t suffer from a lack of over-arching plot.  Criticizing Cowboy Bebop simply because its structure is different is more a failure on the part of the critic than it is a failure on the part of the work.  Take the show for what it is, and you won’t be disappointed.",10,InkSpider,

                 Wether you have experience watching anime or are just a newbie like me, you have probably heard about the so popular and controversial Cowboy Bebop. 
The anime raises two main discussions that i would like to mention in this review: 
- That it's overrated
- That it's ""style over substance""
To the first statement, i partially disagree. To the second one, i am utterly against. Just let me explain. 
I can understand why a person would harbour the opinion that Cowboy Bebop is so popular that people tend to automatically rate it a ten even before starting the series, saying that it has absolutely no flaws
                  whatsoever. No piece of work is free of having flaws, not even this masterpiece of an anime, and that is a fact that we all must face. I can mention a couple if you want me to, like the episodic way in which the series was arranged bringing too many convenient coincidences and abrupt conclusions to some conflicts. But when those flaws acquire little relevance compared to the positive aspects and do not tamper with the overall quality of the show, that's when we find a good series worth watching. 
The enjoyment a person experiences while watching it is completely personal depending on his or her own preferences and that is why i can totally understand the different ratings this series gets. But something i consider extremely important when reviewing any piece of work is separating our own subjective opinion from the objective view. Subjectively, you may enjoy the episodic arrangement of the anime and its theme or not, but objectively it is almost impossible to state that this series does not have lots of magnificent effort put to good use wether its in the audiovisuals or the character development or any other technical aspect. The combination of those two is what makes a propper review. 
That is why it really bugs me when i find people saying cowboy bebop is overrated and then continue justifying it with facts that revolve more around personal tastes than anything else. 
I, for example, don't tend to enjoy nor episodical nor space anime and that is why it took me so long to pick this up. And yes, it  was a little slow to me because of that, but the fact that i enjoyed it anyways and even finished it actually amazed is a proof of good quality. I could have rated it a 9, but i realised it wasn't fair for the series itself when comparing it to the other animes in my list and the ratings i gave them, because Cowboy Bebop seriously seems like it's made of something else. 
Moving on to the ""style over substance"" matter, i do think that's truly a complete nonsense.  Yes, the style is magnificent and we all can agree to that. The art is good though not a wonder to me, but the animation is flawless, especially in the facial expresions and in the space related movements (meaning laws of physics are not broken and it actually seems realistic and coherent). The music is something from another dimension really. Someone could think that it would be a total mess considering all the different genres of music being played that can either match or not the theme of the anime, but in the end that does not even matter because it mixes so well the scene that it's overwhelming. It's like some words are cut because they are not need, it's the music that speaks to you about the atmosphere and how characters feel. 
But style is not merely enough to make an anime good, and here comes the substance of it which i think is fantastic. This is the first anime i have seen so far that made me really think of the characters as real people. They are so well done and their background is for each one of them so very well developed i was really amazed. The action scenes provide their moments of badassery for the characters but are not overly pretentious and do not cross the line of coherence and possibility. The plot could have it's occasional flaws here or there, but it is obvious that it was carefully sewed into place, so as to establish a sequencial plot involved with the past of the characters even in an episodical series. 
Conclusion: please watch it. It really stands out how this anime is different from the rest and a unique piece of work.",10,Kuuderex100,

                To be completely honest I was lucky enough to be introduced to anime through this medium, with its stylistic art and music with help from many a western reference watching this anime was a joy. The characters were great to watch with aspects of mystery that kept you intrigued and guessing, suave Spike, battle-hardened Jet, the smart yet vaguely annoying Edward, and the kinda (well no other way to say this...) bitchy but lovable Faye Valentine. As the show goes on in the latter part of the series it starts to veer off from the western media-inspired tales and tell its own, about spike and
                  the only woman he has claimed to love Julia along with the ever-present threat Viscious. The ending was powerful, stylistic action-packed and really brought the story to an end. Overall 9 out of 10.

                What can I say about this show that hasn't already been said by everyone else that has ever reviewed this show? Despite the fact that I have watch the show beginning to end almost, and the movie which is also great, almost 10 times. Probably not much.
First the bad:
Well, if you are not a fan of action/drama oriented anime this show won't change your mind. That is pretty much all of the bad I can think of in terms of flaws.
The good:
This show is definitely in the top 25 anime for a reason. Fans of action, drama, sci-fi, or film noir anime agree pretty unanimously
                  that this show is a must see.
The animation, despite being nearly 20 years old, holds up extremely well and all the action scenes are still beautiful to look at.
The characters are all memorable, cool, well written, well developed, and 3 dimensional.
The soundtrack is arguably the greatest in all of anime. Especially if you are and lover of jazz and blues.
The writing is amazing. It has some of the greatest dialogue in anime and knows when dialogue isn't needed. The story is presented in a way that does not insult the audiences intelligence and I can't think of a single instance of exposition (when character's speak in a way just so they can give information to the audience).
Also, the dub is incredible. It is arguably the best dub in anime history and a must see. I have talked with people who refuse to watch dubs, that prefer Bebop dubbed. Some of the original Japanese voice actors and the creator of the series himself even admitted that the dub is better.

The show doesn't live on a big storyline. She lives off the bepop crew consisting of Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed and the dog Ein. Each episode deals with a new adventure in a different genre.
The series is split with episodes that are there to entertain and the other half is far more profound than it initially seems.
The most famous antagonist
                  from Cowboy Bepop is probably Vicious from Spike's storyline.
The biggest antagonist the crew has to deal with, however, is the past of the individual members who catch up with them.
The characters are always confronted with their personal past and learn to let go of it and look ahead.
In the conversations within the group, you realize that they all harbor a grudge against each other and don't talk to each other much except when it comes to bounty or food.
As soon as they realize that they need and are dependent on each other, you are already in the last 3 episodes and have to watch with tears in your eyes what is happening with this legendary group of bounty hunters.

                (I apologize in advance if this review turns out to be terrible) Cowboy Bebop. What's there to say about it other than it being one of the most successful 90's animes in the western hemisphere. Its possible (after watching the series) to understand why people hold it in such high regard. Bebop is nothing short of an amazing series where you have a slew of characters that are just plain fun to watch and who get into situations that are always interesting to see how they turn out. I personally found Bebop to be a fantastic show due to it's characters, atmosphere, and soundtrack. If

                TL;DR - The episodic nature that involves different genres is a blessing and a curse, but there is some cohesion between each episode. The characters are full and well-developed and the OST is on another level. Additionally, the show is directed beautifully. Although the age has shown in the art, it still looks good. Watch every episode, but if unsure as to whether to watch to completion, try to watch through at least episode 5. English dub is great, too.
--Full Review--
     Cowboy Bebop is lauded by many to be the one of the greatest, if not the greatest, piece of art
                  to come from Japan. This praise does lead to a lot of exaggeration of what it does right and the ignorance of the flaws which are in this piece of work. This is not to take away from what Cowboy Bebop does well. When it is good, you might have to take a moment to appreciate it, but then again, what I enjoyed might not be your cup'o'tea.
    Cowboy Bebop is episodic in nature, even if the the episodes occur chronologically and a few episodes will recall events of previous episodes. Each episode is a new bounty to collect or a new issue to deal with. There are a few ""two part episodes"", but that is the longest the show presents a continuous event. On top of this, many of the episodes tackle a different theme or concept that seems to be influenced by a western film. An example of this is ""Toys in the Attic"", which is inspired by Alien. This, along with the music selection, makes Cowboy Bebop very friendly for newcomers or the western world.
     This episodic nature can be a curse and a blessing. While a vast majority of the episodes are extremely well done, there are a few episodes that remain unmemorable. One or two of these are agreed upon, but others are debated largely. This stems from the wide variety of subjects and themes. You might not enjoy ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Brain Scratch Fever"" simply because you are not a fan of the thriller, mystery genre, but highly enjoy the comedic nature of ""Cowboy Funk"" and ""Mushroom Samba"" instead. The combination of styles and genres leads to biases from the audience, but at the same time guarantees that there is something for everyone to love.
    However, for a first time watch through, watching every episode is a good idea. They play off of each other very well, and this is part of the reason this show is so highly praised. Each episode fleshes out the crew of the Bebop even more, sometimes causing you to recall previous episodes to see how the character has either changed or remained the same.
    Additionally, for a first time watcher, I recommend trying to stick it out until you have completed episode 5 ""Ballad of the Fallen Angels"". I have yet to read or hear that someone disliked that episode. The characterization, the action, the music, etc. are all present and done well. I have heard other people say that this is where the show really starts. I do tend to agree, but at the same time, the four episodes previous are all necessary to get the most out of it.
     Also, the English dub is really well done. Steve Blum as Spike alone makes the English a recommended watch, but all of the other characters are cast with great choices. I have yet to watch the Japanese except through clips, but I have watched it in English multiple times. I'll stick to English on this one. I tend to not have preference in the matter when picking a show to watch, but this one has my vote for English 100% of the time.
     Now that I got that all out of the way, I'll try to hit the different aspects of the show.
--Story--(8)
     The episodic nature does prevent a true over-arching story to unfold through the show, but each episode carries its own unique personality. All of the episodes are well done, but at the same time, there are forgettable episodes. The backstory, however, is well presented for each character, leading up to one of the best endings for a show that I've ever seen.
--Art--(7)
     For the age of the show, the artwork has held up. It might not be as clean as modern shows, or as fluid, but it still can be breathtaking. The age shows a bit, but how its held up over the years and the use of shots to help tell the story that is being portrayed is a testament to the show itself.
--Sound--(10)
    That the OST for this show is great is practically indisputable. The use of Jazz, Rock, Chorus, and more leads to a beautiful mix of sounds. The OP and ED are also amazing, making it difficult to skip if you tend to do that. Music is also used well throughout the show. It is placed in great moments and really helps get any message across.
--Enjoyment--(9)
     This is something that will vary most among people who have watched this show. Certain episodes will appeal more than others. This is something that is unavoidable, however, the show can still be captivating, even during those episodes that you might think that you would be inclined to skip.",9,Acjking19,

                This show is a timeless classic, after watching I honestly don't know why the heck I kept putting this show off. Because it's one of the best shows I've EVER seen. The music is so outstanding, I had the soundtrack looped for days. The cast is lovable, yet also have their own pasts, their own story. The script is very well written, with a lot of badass quotes you'd want to note down and keep them for use. As for the story... it goes from light-hearted comedy to complex, mature themes, but the balance is perfectly maintained, where serious scenes are weaved into the episodes
                  in little bits and pieces. Despite not getting Spike's past laid out right smack at you, the flashbacks were more than enough for you to piece things together, and the entire process of figuring out is what makes it exhilarating. I'm just sad Ed and Ein had to leave at the end, and that there can never be a continuation to this AMAZING show. Also, animes these days really REALLY need to bring back jazz music fight scenes.",9,karmameister,

                Cowboy Bebop is a quite simplistic series. There's an overarching plot in there, but mostly it's an episodic series that starts the first couple of episodes setting up some plot points, spending an episode in the middle bringing it up again (so you don't forget, I guess) and in the final episode it all comes to a close. The rest of the episodes are basically you following the crew on their adventures and getting to know them a bit more.
Normally, this would be a problem for me. This series, albeit short with only 26 episodes, is like Naruto on steroids. If you decided to skip
                  the episodes that have nothing to do with the set up plot, you would have an anime of about six episodes. However, it's the simplicity of Cowboy Bebop that makes this somehow work. It's not 500 episodes long, which makes me... not mind it at all, so to speak. In fact, it does the job like a charm.
The cast is nice and compact, with only four characters to focus on, which the series does a good job of fleshing out. At the end of the series, I found myself not really having a favourite character, in the sense that every character was nicely balanced out and all just as likable as the other.
My biggest praise goes to the sound design. This series does sound REALLY well. It's a pretty quiet series, featuring sound effects and voice acting mostly. Only on selected occasions are you treated by the series' outstanding music.
In the 23 years long life I've led until now, I never was very big on anime. Sure, I grew up with Pokemon, but that was really about it. Really, this is like my first serious anime. My indifference towards anime completely changed after having finished Cowboy Bebop. It's the first anime I watched from start to end, in about a week or so, and I'm planning to watch many more anime in the future.
Cowboy Bebop is amazing in all its simplicity. It's a mature tale, with nothing too grand and epic. Definitely would watch again.",9,Mega_Potion,

                As my rating shows, this is (completely subjective) a masterpiece.
It has everything that an anime (particularly 90s anime) should have. The right pacing, the right story, the right characterisations, the right visuals, the right soundtracks, and of course the right coda (ending) of the show.
The anime has 26 episodes and that's enough. It does not need seasons to complete or lengthy episodes to solidify its status as a legendary show. It only needs 26 episodes to show the anime that it means business, with the delicate characters like Spike and Faye, strong and mature Jet, with the addition of goofy but intelligent Ed and Ein.
                  26 episodes to explore about humans and their lives; discovering the past, making peace with the past, and even escaping the past. 
The anime also gives lessons like 'things happen for some reasons', 'make your own stride because no one's gonna run your life for you', and 'people are walking on different paths', or at least that's what I saw from the show. Those things add more value to this piece of art.
The only downsides are some episodes could be bland, not as exciting or action-packed as the others, but you will have some favourite moments from this. My favourite episodes are 'Pierrot le Fou', because it crept me out, and the final 2 episodes. Witness them yourself.",10,azz2746,

                !!! COWBOY BEBOP IS AN AMAZING ANIME !!!
Cowboy bebop is a masterpiece, it's amazing, funny, relatable, hyped up and sad, it's everything you'll want in an anime which is perfect. Through all of the characters that may leave or pass, all of the pot twists and how the turn out may end. This anime I cannot nitpick at simply. It's amazing, so lets talk about that.
Cowboy Bebop starts with out protagonist called Spike Spiegel, who if I could describe I find Spike to be Reckless, Relaxed, and a lot like water. In an episode when people think he dies, instead of freaking out like your
                  classic boring protagonist like Deku from My Hero (IMO), what spike does instead is he lights a cigarette and says. ""Oh well, whatever happens happens."" That quote from our amazing protagonist got me hooked into this show and eventually makes him different from all the others characters on the Bebop crew. Whats the bebop crew? Well let me tell you....
The bebop crew is the crew Spike is in during the show, like his team. During the show then end up gaining more characters which could leave, betray, or die at anytime. Plot Armour isn't big in this show so you can't say that there's a huge flay related to it because there simply isn't. A lot of the members are different, We have Spike, our reckless underdog, Jet, the leader and the more quick thinking person of the pack. Faye Valentine. The hot blooded savage of the group, And my favorite member; Edward, who is the comedic, funny thinking mad hacker of this group who uses his skills for a laugh and entertainment.
This show isn't your classic shounen and myself wouldn't even call it Shounen, I would call it art and simply downright amazing with how the characters go, the fight scenes, resemblances and more. If there was anything that I would say would be the worst in the show, the only thing that I could possibly say isn't as good as the other amazing aspects in the show would be the art (which literally isn't bad) also here's a tip but if you turn your brightness down really low then it looks like normal animation and looks really smooth and clean so thank me later. Tee Hee!
Essentially I found this show to be perfect for beginners and to be downright amazing. The fact that Spike's fighting style is Referenced off of Jacky Chan and more and just how the character is made make's him not like any other, and literally just perfect. If you haven't watched this show I recommend you do it now, this is simply amazing

                Anyway, starting off with the usual: the visuals. The art style is somewhat gritty and dark, very similar to Western animation, and misses some of the usual tropes we’ve come to expect from anime – huge eyes, crazy spiky hair, et cetera. The only character who looks particularly anime-like is Faye, but she’s a visual anomaly all to herself. Seriously, what in the world was up with her clothes? I could overlook that in a less serious anime than this but it’s so freaking hard to take the show seriously when this woman is dancing around in a… whatever kind of get-up that is. I
                  don’t even know how to describe it. Anyway, the animation is pretty consistently smooth and good-looking, although they like to notch it up during fight scenes. You’ll rarely see fight scenes as dynamic and sexy as those in Cowboy Bebop. All considered, this anime looks awesome, although not particularly like an anime.
The cast of characters is also obviously influenced by Western entertainment. Spike, the laidback, goofy badass; Jet, the battle-hardened mechanic and only responsible person on the Bebop; Faye, the tempestuous and self-absorbed woman; they all feel like they were pulled right out of a Western show and animated. Ed is the only exception here – she’s too heavily moe to really be anything but an anime character. The show focuses almost exclusively on developing these four characters’ backstories, and resolving their conflicts from the past. All of them have some sort of important past – Spike and Faye especially – and each episode usually happens to bring those pasts back to them. It makes for a cast of characters that have more depth than many I’ve seen in anime before.
The story – yeah, that’s right, also pretty Western-influenced. The show is heavily episodic, where each episode contains its own small story that’s resolved by the end, except for a pair of stories that were both spread into two consecutive episodes. However, like I mentioned earlier, these little stories have a tendency of bringing in, with incredible regularity, parts of the several grander, over-arching storylines that pervade the show. What looks at first like it could be just another bounty being tracked down, might somehow actually connect to some part of Jet’s old life, or Faye’s, or Spike’s, or even Ed’s (although I think Ed only has one episode that deals with her past). And if the episode doesn’t do that, then it instead uses that bounty to highlight the issues of the setting – usually political issues, sometimes just personal issues that have been blown out of proportion. Pretty much every episode has another layer of depth and meaning to it (except maybe the mushroom one because I don’t really know what the point of that one was).
Basically, this anime rocks and you should watch it. It has a startling level of depth and complexity that is uncommon in anime, especially modern anime. The only thing to really look out for is the decidedly non-Eastern style, but I seriously doubt that could ever be a problem. This show is too damn good to dislike for a dumb reason like that.",8,cuckundu,

                THIS IS THE ANIME EVER
To this day, the style and overall direction are unmatched. I adore the smooth execution of the space/sci-fi genre with western and noir influence. 
Bebop is so sure of itself and never wavers in what it set out to do. It oozes with confidence. It's flashy but subtle, it's got attitude but it's also very sensitive - Cowboy Bebop always strikes the perfect balance and I still don't know how they did it.
The overall and per-episode plots as well as the themes were enjoyable. I think everything I have to say about the characters has already been said. Basically, I love
                  them and I will leave it at that.",10,katriellea,

                This anime is an absolute masterpiece. It is a marvel. I can't believe I was lucky enough to be born into an era where art like this exists. Every backdrop, is like a painting. The characters are all memorable. The music is original to the anime and is honestly very good. The music fits the mood of the plot when it's played, and the music helps drive the plot as well. The dialogue is authentic. It feels like real people are interacting witch each other. The story is so mysterious, and every episode has it's own unique story line as well.  
Cowboy bebop has
                  a ""villain of the week"" aspect to it, but there is an over arching storyline. The way they introduce new characters is like finding long lost treasure.  And that actual story is in depth and integral the character development of Spike Speigel. 
Spike, is the coolest character ever. His philosophy is so deep, and so moving. And the fight scenes are so beautifully animated. it is a high octane ride, that's for sure. And people of any IQ can enjoy this. 
This anime DOES NOT slack on production value. And, there is NO FILLER.",10,sirlottawin,

As a very casual anime watcher, this was one of the first series I watched besides the mainstream shounen animes. I was afraid to watch it because of how old it was, but the animation was amazing in my eyes. It gave me a retro, but smooth and crisp feel, the animation aged very finely over the decades. Now, the sound stepped up the anime, with simple vibes yet free-flowing and complimented each scene, which is what the anime was built around. And on to the characters. They seem simple at first, but are more complex as we learn more about the characters, especially Spike
                  Speigel. What really confuses me about him is that he wouldn't seem like the guy to be so thrown over by a girl, or by anything. I was still left with so much confusion about the characters like the backgrounds between Spike and Viscous. The anime provided enough information to fill in most of the rest, but I was still left with many questions after the anime ended. I really enjoyed this anime as the story is simple yet the characters are not, it uses amazing music to add to the already amazing scenes and clean art, this is why it deserves a 9. Now, remember, I'm not the most experienced watcher, but I loved Cowboy Bebop because of how simple it was.",9,Orangeoration,

                The first thing that I need to say is that this anime is highly overrated
STORY :   
The history in some chapter are very good but in must of the chapters are just storys that wev've watched lots of times, like the episode where an alien gets in to the bebop or the episode of the cowboy, they aren´t a copy but you just feel like you watched this already, apart from episodes like 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 20, 23 they feel just meh not bad but not that good to be memorable.
The thing that apears in all episodes is the meaning of
                  letting go you past and live a new life and in all episodes are representes in a way or an other and for me sometimes was a little over used but in almost all episodes these idea was wery well adaptated and ""cool"".
ART : HUH the art in this anime is just simply perfect, hyper fluent animation in combats and spaceship battles it´s just beautiful and the episode that shows this the most is the episode 5 in the church, simply beautiful
SOUND : one of the most iconic soundtracks of all time, what can I say that it hasn´t telled already
CHARACTERS : I will talk about Spike cuase it´s difficult to talk about this anime without making spoilers
Spike : He is the typical lax, floopy or loose character that hides a super cool side, almost all people like this type of character and me I´m not gonna lie I love him too, althaugh he is one of these stereotipical characters, he highlights a lot, his evolution is realy an involution because after the conflict that made him leave the mafia he changed little by little but a part of him was still clinging to his past, thanks to his memories with vicious and Julia",7,ELpal0taku,

This review contains a bit of spoilers there and there
I was young enough to watch this anime when it first came out in the late 90's but I never bothered to watch until 2022 because, as little as I knew, it never clicked with me, I never found it interesting despite I never really watched it, I just had that feeling.
Now in 2022 I know for sure that that feeling I had wasn't wrong, it was spot on; I genuinely have no idea how this anime is so highly scored, it's one of the most plain - boring anime I've ever seen, not super bad,
                  but so ungodly filled with edgy-ness and cliché it's almost unbearable at some points.
Why edgy? because most characters show the maturity or plainly act like teenagers, with only Jet acting vaguely like an adult - what I mean by that? simply put, they're always over-dramatic or over-theatrical, it's like they have a couple of traits each but those traits are so engrossed in each of their action they don't really feel like real people: Spike for example, the main character, is a typical introvert-cool-easy-going type, which is okay when that's a part of your character, what is not ok is when that is ALL of your character, seriously, aside from vaguely hinted tragic backstory filled with all the cliché you could stuff in (an unrequited love, a past you ran away from, a nihilistic yet tranquil behavior).
Even worse, almost no character is really explored despite the serie has 26 episodes plus a movie, ED, Jet and Faye have a backstory that's barely mentioned, yet at times it's treated like of an huge importance in the episode, yet not enough important to explore.
The story flow is a pure mess. The episodes are auto-conclusive and can be seen in pretty much any order, which wouldn't be a problem if this was some sort of slice of life, but instead it's an anime that pretends to have an overarching story which only matters in the last episode and that's it - it's like all the filler episodes (almost all) pretend to be part of a greater story yet they do act like fillers, with nothing of relevance really developed past their own enclosed mini story of a characters you have no time to grow to be attached to to the point you care about for whatever happen in the said episode, resulting in barely any interested from the viewer (me) as, as I just said, these 1-episode characters have zero appearances / mentions outside their own episode; this becomes clear pretty early in the anime so you end up realizing that no matter what happens, it's yet another one-time story with one-time character that is given too much weight for what is worth.
So while the anime wastes time developing 1-episode long characters, it neglects it's main cast to an astonishing degree, only dedicating one or two episodes to the main characters and leaving tiny bits spread among other episodes.
The sci-fi element is staggering bad as well, the anime is supposed to take place around 2070 yet it's clearly just the late 90's with spaceships... the writer clearly didn't even bother to try and image a future, he just took the 90's and added spaceships and THAT'S IT - I'm NOT faulting the writer for not imaging the future ""Right"", I'm faulting the writer for not even TRYING to come up with something, so lazy writing, I hate so much when writers use the sci-fi elements but don't really do anything they couldn't do in the current time with slight differences...
Another BIG problem with the anime is it's lack of a mood, it is a comedy? it is serious? it flip flops with moments clearly absurd moments yet it pretends the viewer to take it very seriously when it says so... 
Also, where the hell is the police? why capturing the criminals, down to small thugs, is the duty of random bounty hunters?
The most lame of all episodes is that one where a kid gains ""Eternal youth"" by staring at a space gate explosion... only problem is: 1) It's not simply ""Eternal youth"", the kid become literally immortal as it can take a bullet in the head and regenerate in seconds, and: 2)Why the hell, in all of of planet earth, he is the only one who got this effect?, not to mention, HOW exactly staring at an explosion or being exposed to some magic rays gives you super regeneration? the anime doesn't even try to explain, it simply happens and damn you if you try to question! you see, the writer wanted to use the genre ""Sci-fi"" but he was too lazy and non-creative to come up with ideas, so instead he used the genre ""Fantasy"" disguised as ""Sci-fi"", and that's because, when things happens with no reason, that's just fantasy, that's magic, that's no ""Sci-fi"" - I myself can come up with a teleporter device that can teleport you from one place to another and call it ""Sci-fi"" when I could to the same thing with a wizard casting a teleport spell on you and archive the same goal... in both cases, I would give 0 explanations so why would bother with the teleporter (Sci-fi) and instead going straight to the Wizard? (fantasy).
The movie is also lame, the antagonist is just some crazy person wanting to destroy the world by killing almost everyone with thin as air reasonings; It's pretty lame the fact that Spike gets shot in the chest in a scene yet he is 100% good as new the next day, while in Episode 26 Jet gets shot in the leg and it's pretty much down for the rest of the episode.
Oh yeah, and let's not forget about ED and just how random she is, at some point she meets a guy that's supposed to be her father but she cares more or less about 0 but then in the same episode ED decides to leave the gang, and the dog follow too, and... that's it, the anime is super anti-climatic when it should have had a bit of an emphasis... maybe? no? okay, whatever; ED's presence was thin as air anyway, she was basically the random super hacker of the show written by someone who clearly doesn't know what hacking looks like (Granted the anime was written in the late 90's but still...), and thinks it's like some sort of high-tech voodoo of some sort, really I've never seen a ""Sci-fi"" this bad.",5,whatever5464,

                People who have seen my previous reviews will most likely understand the style of Anime that I particularly enjoy.
Cowboy Bebop is not an Anime that I enjoy but this doesn't mean that its a bad Anime and in fact, I believe it to be an exceptionally crafted experience and a beautiful episodic piece of art.
Cowboy Bebop throws you into the deep end immediately and doesn't take much time explaining to you how things work in this world and it completely expects you to figure out how it works for yourself while providing an upfront (but not that obvious) paper trail for you to follow as
                  it slowly begins expanding and winding you in deeper with seemingly disconnected stories.
The animation at times can come across as a bit stilted and blocky but when the series decides to open up you'll find that there is also a lot of craft that has been put into it that can make you completely forget about other minor details that may appear throughout.
Dealing with themes of loneliness, the past, transhumanism and sorrow Cowboy Bebop tells a rather mature story through stylistic influences ranging from noir, old westerns and martial arts movies.
The soundtrack consists of beautifully blended yet diverse soundscapes with musical influences ranging from blues, jazz, funk and sometimes a hint of country.
I might not enjoy Cowboy Bebop and a large part of that may stem from the fact that I might not just 'get it' but I don't believe that I don't need to 'get' something in order to appreciate it for what it is.
I feel as though I'm missing out on appreciating this anime to its fullest but on the other hand I can confidently give this anime a 9/10 and say that if you're a fan of westerns, noirs, martial arts, cult classic films or any of the music genres I've mentioned before then you'll certainly find something in Cowboy Bebop that you can enjoy.
And on a final note, I just want to say that without Cowboy Bebop I might never have gotten into Jazz so for this I'm forever thankful.",9,GrimmChicken,

                It’s no surprise Cowboy Bebop is so popular in the west. It’s clearly heavily influenced by westerns and sci fi. From Blade runner to the good the bad and the ugly. At its best Cowboy Bebop is a fantastic show with fun characters and a gripping story. However there were too many instances when I thought to myself ‘why’?
Let’s start with the story, it’s wonderful. The show centres around Spike Spiegel, a former gang member turned bounty hunter. Who teams up with Jet, a former cop, Faye, a debt ridden gambler with amnesia and Ed a little girl with incredible hacking skills. While the story
                  does have a overarching plot it’s only prevalent in a few episodes. The rest are self contained story’s that make our characters grow. This sounds like a recipe for disaster, but for the most part it actually works. I say the most part because there are a few episodes which seem to exist to pad out the episode count. Which is baffling, (but I’ll get onto that later). 
The characters are all really likeable. Spike is fun, loving and has a tragic past. Jet is honest, has a heart of gold but can also make mistakes. At first I hated Faye due to her addiction with not just gambling, but cheating too. However once I found out why she does this, it changed my perspective completely. However once aspect that didn’t change was Ed. Seriously Ed is by far the worst character on this show. She adds absolutely nothing to the main plot. And that would have been fine if she developed, but she doesn’t. And what makes it frustrating is that they had the perfect opportunity. In episode 24 Ed meets her father who abandoned her at a young age. The two seem to bond for a bit and he even offers to take her along. Though he leaves before she has a chance. Ed then leaves the crew, implying she’s going out to find him. And she’s written out of the show! No end of an arc you yourself started! And with that whole killer leftovers and hallucinogenic mushrooms episodes could you not have time to finish Ed’s arc? 
Then we have the ending. Everyone says it’s a masterpiece, and I just don’t see it. The main problem is that the ending conflicts with the main theme of the show. It’s about facing and moving on from your past. Except when Spike does eventually move on, he’s retroactively punished for it. I don’t understand what happened, Faye’s arc was done so well, so why wasn’t spikes. 
Overall Cowboy Bebop was a fun ride that unfortunately fell at the last few hurdles.",7,SSXXIII,

                Cowboy Bebop takes you on this awesome journey accompanied with a perfectly matched soundtrack. It has a retro vibe and uses the power of different types of genres to glue together an interesting story.
First of all, the music totally slaps. With a mix of jazz and blues it creates the perfect mood for each scene. Music is also import as it matches the pace at which events happen. It’s composed just like live music at a musical and that is what makes it so magical.
Sound design overall is just very pleasant. FX is very fitting for the devices used.
The last aspect about sound is that
                  the voice acting is superb. Each character just lives on your screen , partially due to the lively voice acting and fitting voices.
Each character has a load of personality. Each is very defined but also refined. Modern characters could be summed up in a few sentences, but the character from cowboy bebop their mannerism let them write books about themselves.
First off our protagonist Spike. A charismatic person, long slender and surprisingly strong. He’s a real marksman when it comes to shoot-offs and he’s a great pilot as well. We don’t know much of him but a few fragments from his past. So you can add an air of mystery to him as well. What makes him so likeable is that he unlike modern protagonist, Spike is actually doing is job as a cowboy, not being bother about doing the right or wrong thing.
Jet is also a lovable person. He almost looks like a toy monkey. Being the engineer of the ship we get to see him a little bit less in action. An interesting thing is that he sees Spike as a comrade but not as a necessity.
Lastly we have our fairy Faye Valentine. My personal favorite of the show. She’s a femme fatale, being also skilled at flying and shooting she helps Spike in getting bounties or into trouble. Her amnesia makes her yearn to know more about her past.
All these 3 characters are desperately trying to look forward but they are bound by their past. They have something to look back to or to regret and that is also what motivates certain story elements. When the end of the series is nearing everything sort of beautifully falls into place with each other.
Bonus mention Edward (aka Ed). She’s absolutely adorable. Her carefree attitude and her hacking skills are so funny to watch. She’s a real waifu 10/10 with such a great skin tone.
I could thoroughly enjoy this anime. The plot elements are amazing. Everything fits within that one episode but also connects to the bigger picture. It mixes a bit into action and slice of life. There were episodes which had a very light and joyful tone and others were very heavy. Cowboy Bebop mixes just the right amount of mood each time creating a perfect ambiance thorough the story without feeling out of place once.
For some scenes I was really feeling up or down, with the character. The anime succeed in making me emotionally invested in the events largely because of the right soundtrack.
The action was also plenty. It was really nice to see a skilled gunman without him being overly protected by plot armor. On top of that the flow of hand to hand combat was also really refreshing to see.
In summary, Cowboy Bebop brings a mix between action and slice of life accompanied with the perfect soundtrack. The 26 episodes together are one coherent story but every episode can also be seen as a standalone. The feeling of them just being free and roaming the galaxy is so liberating. If you like retro styled space cowboys then this your perfect fit!

Probably one of the most unique and original animes I have seen in a while. It had a very interesting and amazing worldbuilding I mean who thought of doing a sci fi anime that takes place in the future in our solar system which has 2000s technology except for the spaceships and having a old school vibe/tone it. The consistency of this anime was alright, some episodes were just amazing and out of this world and others were a bit dull and were ok.
The visuals were good. The art was alright, it didn't have that sharp and crisp look to it,
                  everything seemed a bit unclear and undetailed. But the animation was amazing especially the fight scenes which was hype and the character designs which felt unique and original. The music was just everything! I shouldn't even be explaining. Jazz, country, mixed in with music from Japan it was just sweets for my ears.
The characters were good. Even though we didn't get to know about much about the character cast's past they really did an amazing job on writing characters that were original and felt fresh. They had interesting flaws and unique personalities. Majority of the screentime went to the main characters and there were barely any recurring characters.
Overall a enjoyable series. It had some flaws and some confusing parts but also a lot of hype and just crazy moments. It leaves some questions behind and makes the viewers answer it themselves which was sort of a double edged sword for me.",8,WazThatTL,

                why I loved this show:
- OST and sound affects are top notch. Its soundtrack is really unique and one of the things that make CB stand out from the rest of the anime shows 
- Characters are original and interesting, therefore, character driven storytelling works really good
Faye is a very well written femme fatale 
Spike and Jet work well as a duo, and their different personalities makes a good match 
Ed is just goofy genius kid, but for me, it felts sincere and she made me smile lots of times
team of ed, faye, ed, spike and jet makes a dynamic team with each of them
                  being interesting enough on their own. Almost all of them are enigmatic, and it makes the viewers even more curious about them.
- We learn the background of all characters, and all of their stories are well written. The emotions of the characters are reflected to the audience masterfully. 
- Ending of the show is very conclusive and impressive
- This show's best quality is in its directing. Each scene is placed carefully, and piece by piece we learn more about the story. Some of the scenes are set really good, and stand out a lot (for example: church scene)
- animation is really good considered that this is a 90s anime
-although it is episodic, it's not boring and it manages to tell an overall story regardless. Many people criticize episodes in which we don't see Spike vs Vicious story, but I think they also serve well in terms of entertainment, giving a message on their own, and also showing characters where these conflicts don't exist (spoiler: they also fit well with concept of ""fleeting dream"" that Spike has).
- I liked that most of the episodes were named after songs
-This show is a very good example of ""show, not tell."" You can see this from just the dialogues. You never get someone explaining what's happening for 20 mins like lots of other show does. Instead events are shown through addition of details, and dialogues are used purposefully, rather than being used as a plot device. 
-almost every aspect of the show is well thought. You can tell that it is really done with lots of effort. If you watch carefully, you'll be surprised by how even the smallest details were considered. 
overall: 10/10. For me, the show deserves its vibe to the fullest. It really is a genre of its own. It's not so good if you are looking for an action rush and plot driven story. It's extremely good if you enjoy character-driven stories like I do.",10,boredweeb_012,

                I'm not sure why, but I've gotten into giving reviews lately so I felt the need to explain why I personally rate this anime a 10/10 and have it as one of my absolute favorites. 
I'm not like most of the die hard fans of Cowboy Bebop however. I didn't grow up watching it, or get into anime because of it (though I could have). I hadn't even heard of it until I was in high school and talked with a friend about anime. I remember watching the first episode and thinking ""not bad, not bad. But I need to see more before I can
                  determine if I like it."" By episode 5 I was hooked. 
The story might not be the greatest, but given the fact it is episodic, I'd say it's decent enough to be entertaining. The art style while dated, is still unique and interesting to me even now. But the true greatest part of this anime is it's soundtrack. Of course with Yoko Kanno as the composer the scores are going to be fantastic anyway, but still, it has to be mentioned that the soundtrack is amazing. As for the cast, well Jet, Spike, Faye, and Ed all remind me of real people, so I'd say they did a fantastic job of making them likable and personable.",10,Brad_Wine,

Cowboy Bebop is the first anime that I've watched from start to finish that didn't leave me with a, ""OMG THAT WAS SO FCKUING GOOD SFETGSTIOERLF"" feeling. It's not that I didn't like it, I mean obviously since I watched the entire thing, but the story left me a little...unsatisfied tbh. Idk betweenn Faye who was annoying as fuck (except in the last episode) and all this other shit that happened, I expected so much but was left with so little really. I can see why it's managed to stay in the top 30 for so long, but it just wasn't for
                  me. But it was good, but Idk. If the story had managed to end in a slightly positive light whilst at the same time making Faye less annoying over time, I would've liked it more, but it sucked in regards of story and character. The only character who was introduced that didn't annoy me was Ed. I liked her so much I made my first gifset in awhile out of her (if you wanna see then here https://animeesthetic.tumblr.com/post/162791514595)
As for the music and art, well the art was good. And the music inspired the material for my 4th Nocturne (I' m a composer), which is why I'm giving this anime a 9.While the music was good enough to inspire me, the characters and their development over the course of the show was heavily lacking and the story was a little bit too downtrodden (although tbh I expected Spike to die in the end), but it wasn't enough to kill my overall enjoyment thanks to the music and Ed. So yeah.",9,Izaya,

                There are many shows or movies that have such a massive fan base and are held as undeniable classics of their genre. Many of which I disagree with. Titanic isn't very interesting to me, nor does beloved anime like My Hero Academia interest me very much either.
However, Cowboy Bebop is very much worthy of its status as a classic of the Anime medium.
Defining what makes this show such a classic is both easy and challenging. On the outset, it's a simple show; two Cowboys (or Bounty Hunters) fly around in the spaceship named 'Bebop' roam the galaxy looking for bounties to catch in hopes of
                  paying for their next meal. There's action, comedy and moments of drama thrown into the mix, shown against Jazz and Blues music. It seems simple.
But if you dive deeper, the show is more complex than that. 
Alongside most episodes that are self-contained in nature (described by the show's creator Shinichiro Watanabe as 'short films) are episodes that have an overarching theme running through them; the nature of one's past. Easy to ignore but hard to forget. The three main characters (Cool guy Spike Spiegel, Head of the Bebop and somewhat down to earth Jet Black and Faye Valentine, a girl with a strange and unsure past) all go through their own story arcs and development within themselves.
Let's look at the show more in depth and break it down:
Story: 10/10
Story is the interesting part of the show. For what we get, Cowboy Bebop's story is tightly written and layered in mystery. While the show is largely episodic in nature, we do get small segments of the overarching story woven through it. The main story is told through only 5 episodes; A stand-alone episode and 2 double part episodes. These were probably my favorite parts of the show. But that doesn't mean that the stand-alone episodes outside these 5 are lesser, as they are all entertaining to some degree. Whether it's an episode that's more light-hearted or one that tackles a meaningful theme, every episode of Cowboy Bebop is written extremely well. Every line of dialogue and every solution to their current episode's problem are tight and well worth it.
Art: 10/10
Cowboy Bebop is a beautiful show to look at. Taking inspirations from Film-noir, Sci-Fi and the Western genre, particularly American and European movies and shows from the past, Cowboy Bebop uses a lot of unconventional 'camera' angles that aren't used much in anime (especially modern anime), but are common in Film Noir flicks from the 40s. Harsh lighting with stark contrasts are seen in a lot of dark scenes with angles that highlight scale and importance to certain characters or events. 
The designs of the spacecraft and future technology have that old aesthetic from 80s films set in the future where everything looks like it's from the 80s (or 90s in this case) but simply have a small Sci-Fi twist on them. Character designs are distinct and memorable, the colors used are vibrant while managing to look bleak depending on the atmosphere and the intro is one of the most memorable looking intros to any Anime
Sound: 10/10
Jazz and blues are all over the show. From fight scenes, to chase scenes, to space battles, to moments when the characters are just lazing around with nothing to do. Every piece of music fits the scene like a glove. The jazz brings out the film-noir atmosphere, with heavy brass and piano sections sitting alongside the deep expanse of the galaxy, to Spike fighting hand to hand with opponents. The blues brings out the western influences, with slide steel guitar set upon beautiful shots of the baking hot sun on the deserts of Mars and Earth, or to bars where everyone smokes and drinks.
For dialogue, it's interesting to note that this is a show that is widely known for the strength of its English dub. While most shows have dubs that may be considered bad or on par with the Japanese audio, Cowboy Bebop's dub is considered far stronger than its Japanese audio. Every dub voice was picked flawlessly. Steve Blum as Spike is pitch perfect an every one of his lines avoids the typical dub problems of either being too over the top or rushing lines to fit all the words into the frames of dialogue. It feels almost as though the show was written for the dub in mind.
Character: 10/10
This is where the show succeeds the most. I loved every character in Cowboy Bebop. Spike is by far one of the coolest characters ever written. From his carefree attitude, his demeanor, his crooked cigarette and even his Bruce Lee influenced fighting style that is almost like a dance routine, Spike oozes coolness and suave. He's also a fairly sophisticated character, with multiple levels to his personality and with a backstory that explains his dislike for women (though it's in no way a sexist or misogynistic reason).
Jet Black is Spike's crewmate, though he is actually the Captain of their ship 'Bebop'. If Spike is the mysterious cowboy with a troubled past, Jet is the straight man. He tries on occasion to knock sense into Spike, though it mostly falls on deaf ears. He usually tries his best to trust people, though if they can't pay debts back, that trust only goes so far.
Faye Valentine is the lead female character. Her past is the most interesting off all, one that I don't wish to ever spoil for anyone. She dresses lightly in a way that could be considered objectifying, but she dresses this way to get what she wants. It's easy to have a main female character be the center of the two male character's affections as a love interest, but Cowboy Bebop never goes there. In fact, Jet and Spike usually can't stand her most of the time. Faye is allowed to stand on her own.
There're other characters in Cowboy Bebop too, but are best left to discovering yourself for the first time.
Enjoyment and Overall score: 10/10
Every minute of every episode in Cowboy Bebop is enjoyable, crafted beautifully by people who love what they do and understand how to make a multi layered show that seems to be simplistic at first look. 
A true masterpiece of Anime",10,TheShadowKnows31,
1,"
                Cowboy Bebop is arguably the most iconic and influential anime series ever made. Its influence can be seen in western media everywhere, from the movies of Quentin Tarantino to the lyrics of a modern rap song, i would say it is the most american anime ever made, being inspired by american Jazz music as well as western movies from the 60´s.
Altough Bebop´s influence is gigantic, i´ve always struggled with the actual story being told, but honestly, at the end of the day, that doesnt really matter. The episodic nature of the series unfortunatelly ruins what could be a potentially great story if the creators decided
                  to make a straight foward narrative rather than put random episodes that dont mean anything in the middle of 2 great episodes that actually develops and progress what is being told, still, even though the story is its weakest point, the greatness of everything else makes me not care about the wasted potential that the Spike vs Vicious storyline could have been. That being said, i absolutely adore the way the last 2 episodes wrap up the narrative, even though the journey of getting to those last 2 episodes were good, but not great.
the art and aesthetic of bebop is probably my favorite in all anime. It has a melancholic  and atmospheric vibe to it, specially spike´s flashbacks. I love the contrast between western clothing, weapons and cheap cigarrette smoke with the futuristic and cyberpunk landscapes and technology, it makes for a very unique journey through the depths of a world that almost feel alive, as if the places they go to are actual characters rather than just set pieces
so lets talk about them, the characters. I love every single one of the main five characters, they have some of the best chemistry i´ve ever seen, and slowly seeing them going from a bunch of depressed outlaws to an actual family that cares about each other is great. It is one of those shows where you really get immersed with them, feeling as if you are there rather than being just a passive outsider. Spike, although we dont get to see a lot of what makes him the man he is, we see enough to make us care and connect with him. He is a broken man haunted by his past, never going foward, just trapped in this infinite cycle of trying to relive the good old days where things were happy, and that can be said about all the characters, they are all people with nothing to live for, they just exist, they dont have any goal in mind, just everyday drowning in their on melancholy and desperately trying to let go of their dark past, but  never actually succeding at it, except for spike, who, poetically enough, only moves on after his death, the only way of him to be happy and forgive himself is to end his life in a final battle with his old friend turned enemy, also killing him in the process, and that my friends, is the main message of the anime.
Dont be like Spike, Jet and Faye, dont let the shit that happened in your past be the reason why you cant move foward, as the final scene of the show says, ""you are gonna carry that weight"", because carrying that weight and dealing with your past mistakes face to face is the only way of achieving happiness and let go of suffering.
in the end, i unfortunatelly cant give this a 10, because there are at least 7 very unninteresting episodes that have no reason to exist and mess with the pacing that could have been great, it for sure would be a 10 if it had lets say 18 episodes rather than 26. But anyways, Cowboy Bebop is fun, tragic and poetic, and definitelly one of the most fun i had with an anime.

                This anime is just, wow. the characters are entertaining,the plot is good but sometimes I cannot keep track of it. The jazz is one of the best I've heard from anime, probably the best part for me. I mean, its impossible to hate this anime. I watched the dub version on Toonami long ago and enjoyed it so much. Wish it had more hand-to-hand combat though since those scenes are my favorite. It took me quite a while to remember this until Netflix announced their adaptation of this and I thought ""wow i hate netflix"" but still wonder how they would approach this anime.

                Finally, I had some time to write my first review this anime sure deserves much more.
This was really a great ride 26 episodes of enjoyment this series was really outstanding it had a lot of influence on me I really enjoyed it starting by:
Story: Although it didn't have a major plot it was still enjoyable for an episodic show this was really one hell of a ride 9/10
Art: The art was really special and unique not like these days anime which one eye is bigger than the other, to be honest, it was 85% like a Ghibli movie really outstanding, and it had a mix
                  of the western cartoon on it I really like that of course in a Japanese anime style. 10/10
Sound: I really loved the voice actors they were really awesome and I thank them for their great work on this show, the sound effects were great for 1998 anime it was really outstanding. 10/10
Character: I think this show was mostly successful because of the uniqueness of these four main characters as well as the others, each one had their own attitude and they didn't change it for some any reason except major things 10/10
Enjoyment: it was really enjoyable, but I would have loved it more if there was more dark and hopeless and despair in it 8/10
Overall: it was a very Great show that I would definitely watch it again in the future. 9/10",9,Raizel,

                I hadn't seen a sci-fi anime in a while and heard great things about Cowboy Bebop, from long ago even, so when it was on sale via Amazon Prime I jumped on it, and I am glad I did.
Without giving anything away from the story, I can say that the characters are likable, animations is well-done, story-line entertaining, and music is outstanding. For me, I was only disappointed that it ended so soon.
Why is there no sequel?!
Alrighty, I couldn't submit the review yet as the website says what I had said above was too short. Out of the grab-bag is my opinion of Faye. She
                  has issues she needs to work through. What is up with that outfit she wears? Super-sexy, but I can't imagine she could stay warm in that.",9,s0methingrare,

                A boy I liked said one day: ""Have you heard 'Tank'? You have to hear 'Tank'.""  He sent me the album version, and insisted any series with music this good has to be worth a watch.
Most of the episodes are self contained, and oddly enough, it works.  It is actually easier to get hooked because even though there's a good overarching story with many small details, they're scattered throughout the series and you don't get bogged down with plot point overload.  The characters are consistent and realistic, and gradual changes happen along those oneshot stories.
At the end of it all, the phenomenal
                  music is the shining star of this series.  Episode Five, ""Ballad of Fallen Angels,"" is one of the best scored episodes of TV.  Period.  Yoko Kanno is a genius; she incorporates such a wide variety of music, and still manages to tie it together.",9,gryffchick,
1,"
                This show is absolutely brilliant. Allow me to elaborate on why.
When you first get in to watching this show it has a calm, nostalgic atmosphere.
like watching cartoons as a kid. It would remind me of the old days sitting at home, playing DVD after DVD, wondering if Batman would stop The Joker, what kind of antics Buggs and the loony toons would get up to or thinking to myself 
""Is it truly possible for Ash to catch em' all"". Mix that feeling with beautiful scenes, the greatest sound track I've ever heard, the most delved in to 
characters there are and some excitement, space adventure
                  and slightly more adult themes, and you have Cowboy Bebop. The story is beautiful, complex and special to me. The art reminds me of a simpler time in anime. The soundtrack to this show is spectacular, it's as though they looked at each scene and immediately knew the perfect music for it. Not to mention the fight scenes perfect choreography, the flow of each hand to hand fight that Spike has, just takes my breath away. Truly a work of art, and 100% worth the watch.",10,IshidaZA,
1,"
                Cowboy Bebop is the most essential anime out there.  It is an example of everything good, of everything an anime can be.  From the stellar voice acting, to the catch tunes, to the imaginative set pieces, to the tight and flawless writing.  Even if this is an anime you dont think you will like it is something you should probably watch anyway in much the same way every film buff will say to watch Citizen Cain even if they dont like it.  Cowboy Bebop is the Citizen Cain of anime.
If you call yourself an anime fan, and you haven't seen this
                  show by now: watch it.  Seriously.",10,Wizard1,
1,"
                Its just some people that like this anime and it is those who like philosophy of the anime. The anime is about the tragic story of every character. The music and the artwork has a lofi feeling whitch is nice. So if you have time on the night you should watch it. But when you start watching it can be boring in the start but its get bether. So if like philosophy and filososfi you should go watch it. And if you like neon genesis you will like it but its not the same but in some ways. Add me if you want to talk
                  about the anime=)",10,AllMyAnimes1,
1,"
                Finding the words to describe Cowboy Bebop proved to be more difficult than I imagined. The series is a true masterpiece of animation and one of few that genuinely deserves a 10 rating across the board.
Of all the elements in the show, the one worthy of special mention is the music score, composed by Yoko Kanno. It is undoubtedly some of the most atmospheric music of any series and one the show is best known for.
The plot is nonlinear. While each character has an underlying agenda, it is their environment that ultimately decides where life takes them. Scripting for the show is exceptional; episodes are
                  nicely varied and the dialogue is very well-written and spoken from the mains to the supporting.
Besides the music, the next most recognizable aspect of the series is the characters. Each and every one of them has a meticulous design and personality, backed with outstanding art, fluid animation and excellent voice acting. All of this, combined with the aforementioned material, comes together in the form of realistically fleshed out and convincing figures.
Cowboy Bebop, in every regard, is a show of excellence. It more than backs its legacy and name among anime with painstaking visuals, beautiful music and believable characters. A must watch.",10,valce,

                Cowboy Bebop is an unforgettable ride. This show is a masterclass in subtle storytelling, character building, and undeniable style. The way the universe feels so lived in and understandable without ever having to ham-fist explanations as to how things like atmosphere-regulation works is something very few works are able to accomplish this stunningly. Yes, the action is great, yes it's humorous and clever, but it's episodes like ""Speak Like A Child"" that really shine through, providing profound emotional depth for characters who aren't always willing to show their insides like they're being watched. The PEOPLE on this show are complex and utterly real to an
                  extent no other show I have ever watched has been able to reach. This show is perfect.",10,b4bystand,
1,"
                Oh boy another bebop review h a h a
Gonna make it simple because this show is talked about to death but I'll say that I get the hype. I get why people love it so much. This show has a few layers beneath it that I really dig but I do think it's important to talk about bebop the right away before introducing it to someone. 
If you dig neo noir cool and the anime aesthetic then you'll pretty much dig this right away and will have no problem being hooked for all 26 episodes. But if you're like me and need something a bit
                  more to commit to that length, well let me just say that I don't think the show gets really good until the final 3rd of the series. 
Up until that point, the show leans more into its episodic format with slight glimpses of its characters' cores with a change happening after the mid-series' 2 parter. I believe after episode 13, the show gets more interesting and eventually more wacky, which by that point we're given genuine reason to care about these people vs just their overall cool factor. 
If we see this series as 2 seasons, then I'd argue that eps. 1-13 are about a 7/10 because it's very much more aesthetic vs substance (and a damn cool aesthetic to boot). But the writing in season 2 gets very involved with this cast and in some ways, the more tender moments take center stage, rendering it a 8-9/10. Unfortunately that's not the case as it was possibly conceived as 1 large season but maybe that's more of a me issue idk. 
In the end, Bebop is a good show. Your mileage will depend on your taste but if episode 1 doesn't grab you then I'd suggest checking out episodes 15 (a faye valentine character study), 20 (an acid trip horror theme chase), 22 (a goofy deconstruction of spike's character), and 23 (a simple premise with heavy cyberpunk themes). It's not spoilers because it's still episodic by this point and you can actually see how far they take these characters, maybe get hooked, all while also having a good time in the process.",7,radicalman,
1,"
                I think the beauty of this show is the fact that it follows a (mostly) normal group of bounty hunters. There is a sort of charm of having a protagonist that is not super powerful or special, but rather that its their more realistic problems and how they are dealing with life is. Im very glad I watched this show without much knowledge, because I got to enjoy it for what it was and not have certain parts spoiled or hyped. 
They did a good job of sprinkling in episodes and bits that further explained the backstories of the characters, and by having it sort
                  of build up inbetween episodes of somewhat ""nothingness"" really drove home the point that sometimes, life is messy, and just like how most of our issues dont jump out at us, we start to see our group of space cowboys, cowgirls and cowdogs, are all dealing with their own personal problems constantly without us knowing. 
This show reminded be a lot of my old friend, that at first glance it can seem ""mundane"" or even boring at parts, but the more you look the more you start to notice, and that my friends is what really sold this show to me. Like many others, its a real gem, but its important to understand that it will take things slow at times, and sometimes, thats okay.",8,AnAverageAvian,

                This anime was well done and actually very interesting in many ways. The development of the characters was done very well and the introduction of the problems. The setting, which is in the future, is one of my favorite settings in any anime because of its alomst realistic and possible content. I enjoyed this anime very much for the violence as well. The amount of violence is actual perfect in theis anime.

                I have never seen a great complete anime before this one. I started watching this anime on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. But I always missed crucial episodes. So I finally sat down at my computer to watch most of the series and I must say I was very impressed, everything from the beginning to the end was well done, the artwork, the music, the story. I loved this anime to death dispite the fact that there was a lot of violence on this anime. The characters though are so remember-able each had growth of personality in the series. I mean the only thing that I
                  didn't like about this series is the cliffhanger at the end of the last episode left you wondering what happened. Besides that great all the way through. There is a reason why I think Cowboy Bebop is the if not the best Anime of all time.",9,Whitedmn,

                ""I’m not going there to die; I’m going to find out if I’m really alive."" -Spike Spiegel
Cowboy Bebop is a philosophical journey exploring the identity of human soul and the meaning of life through three main characters with haunting pasts (plus Ed and Ein). The crew journeys throughout the universe as bounty hunters, learning on the way the sense of camaraderie and sense of self-identity. And through thrilling Western fighting scenes and episodic stories of various individuals, Cowboy Bebop extends to the idea of death and existentialism.
So is Cowboy Bebop a Classic? Definitely.
Story: 8/10
The concept the Cowboy Bebop explores is, as I explained earlier, beyond
                  the surface. As one learn more about the characters' past, the more one delves into their shoes. And with an episodic format, Cowboy Bebop is a perfect anime in which you can drop and pick up late without losing important elements of the story. And any western movie fans would just love the action inside this series
But why isn't this a masterpiece in this department? The concept of reality and fiction is, I'd say, way to much mingled.
It just feels awkward that in the age of space travels, all the protagonists use pistols rather than futuristic weapons or just even any other assault weapons. What's even more absurd is the fact that the main characters leave without much injury even against hundreds of machine guns without any protective gear. The villains are always a terrible shot for some reason, and the protagonists are way to good of a shot. And some action inside space just breaks the laws of physics alongside casual logic. I know that Cowboy Bebop is more symbolical of a story than a realistic one, but the boundary of fantasy and reality needs to be clear.
TL DR; Nice symbolical concepts. But blurred line of reality and fantasy.
Art: 8/10
This was made before 2000. Amazing art for the time.
Sound: 9.5/10
Nice jazzy soundtracks that fit with the melancholy mood of the series. It even has an iconic opening theme that will almost never be forgotten by those who watch this series. Background music and sound effects are placed on right times. 
Character: 9/10
The characters seem simple yet complicated. The interactions between the pure (Ed and Ein) and the impure (Spike, Jet, Faye) is just perfect for the exploration of the human soul. The characters are one-dimensional and complex at the same time, making them feel just so human. 
They feel like people we can relate to rather than a character trapped in a different dimension.
Enjoyment:9/10
The action packed western style action anime was a good refreshment for me. But this show may not be the best for binge-watching as these are episodic. But the story adds up, so don't skip episodes. Just slowly watch this anime from time to time.
Overall: 9/10
Just an anime series any devoted anime fan should watch. The word ""classic"" perfectly fits this anime.",9,xre,

                My favorite thing about Cowboy Bebop is how motley of a crew they all are and the interaction between characters. The action is ok but nothing special. But character development is where this anime really excels. They pretty much go into everyone's backstory well enough to give you a good idea of what makes them tick. 
Can move along a bit slow at times but for the most part has a good mixture of comedy, action; seriousness and sillyness.

It is kinda episodic, but small plot-crumbles are hinted here and there, then at certain points it just blasts you with it.
Setting/worldbuilding is very nice, plays an organic part in the story.
But what really made the show are the characters and their dinamic, combined with the great writing, each of the main trio/squad are memorable.
Animation is outstanding, especially for a 1998 production, sadly is 4:3.
Very clever writing, as it will grab you by the balls from episode one, and just occasionally let go for the more lighthearthed moments.
The internet seems to hype it up, and for a valid reason, amazing show overall.

                Masterful written plots on an episodic format that culminates into a beautiful bitter sweet ending anyone could ask for! The Philosophical themes and the variety of genre's crammed into it's 26 episodes are very engaging and are still relevant even today. I just loved the main characters as they wonder around aimlessly and without purpose on a seemingly living breathing world of Cowboy Bebop looking for there missing catharsis while observing the side characters going through there own hardships and raison dêtre.

                It's Cowboy Bebop. I am not a skilled enough writer or analyst that I can tell you something new about one of the most famously influential and excellent anime of all time. Everything that can be said about it? It's been said. It's good. If you haven't watched it, you should. If you have watched it, you probably don't need any more reassurance. 
It's in the debate for one of the greatest anime of all time. And it deserves to be there. I must struggle to find a flaw in this thing, and what I do find is very small. Chances are, if you don't
                  like cowboy bebop, it's because one element of the format just wasn't for you. And that's okay. If you hate sushi, the most expertly crafted roll will not win you over. If you detest the texture of fine steak you'll scoff at the most succulent cuts of beef. But hopefully you can appreciate it for what it is--masterful.",10,Connspirator,

                To begin, I will say that I rarely watch anime anymore, and when I do nowadays it's usually older ones that weren't/aren't mainstream. I left all of that shonen stuff back in middle-early high school where it belongs (I'm already nearing 30). I try to watch more nowadays, it's just there is rarely any anime that pulls me in, but I digress.
Review: 
Great music, great setting, great art, great characters, meh overarching plot. In the end it was little above average. When it was good it was REALLY good. When it wasn't it dragged on forever and I couldn't wait to get to the next
                  episode already. 
I didn't really have any expectations going in other than forums recommending it. But it started to wane around halfway through the series. I understand that the anime is episodic (I've greatly enjoyed other episodic animes like Baccano! and Samurai Champloo), but a number of episodes around the middle of the series clearly stood out to me as not as enjoyable to watch. 
Story-wise, what CB ends up being for me is simply a story of existing. ""Simply"" being the keyword here because I feel like that is the reason why the show didn't wow me, yet however, it was uniquely bland. Everything simply existed; happened. I think that's part of the beauty of it; it wasn't anything special. No mind-blowing philosophical themes are shoved in your face a la Psycho Pass. No big revelations or thrills. Life in the universe of CB simply is what it is, and like the ending, it just goes on. Implicitly, there is a lot to say there that takes a little finesse to figure out.
I will say that CB is a damn good gem. I haven't seen anything like it. But it didn't blow me away. It was subtle. I don't think I would want to rewatch it anytime soon. Maybe when I'm a lot older again and life has taken its course.",8,Sakurazaki,

                I started my journey into anime when I was 15, after watching the original run of Neon Genesis Evangelion on some random website that probably gave my old laptop a million viruses (I promise you I am going somewhere with this, stay with me).  From there I was hooked, unfortunately it would still be a long time until streaming services had more than just Naruto available and the heyday of Toonami was over. I had no other friends who watched anime and it was overwhelming to shift through what was available to watch by myself, lost I turned to YouTube anime recommendation videos. By
                  and large Cowboy Bebop was almost always at the top of the recommendation list, so I thought screw it, I'll give it a go.
And I started it, in 2016. I finished it in 2021, five years later. Initially, I wasn't hooked I watched a few episodes and thought it was pretty good but I didn't really get it and so my mind got occupied with other anime and other aspects of life. Over the remaining span of my teenage years I would watch another episode here or there, not really feeling any urgency to find out what happened next or continue on with the story because of it's episodic nature I could jump in and leave as I pleased without feeling lost. I was neither compelled or dissuaded from the story until I started binge watching TV (and subsequently anime) in the wake of 2020. Blah blah blah, we all know it's been hard and lock-down sucks I will spare the ""unprecedented times"" spiel. But I found myself returning to Cowboy Bebop to really give it a real try, by this point it had taken me four years to get about 7 episodes deep. You may be thinking, why would I try so hard for a show I clearly wasn't interested in? Here's the thing, I was interested. The animation and stylized characters are beautifully designed and fascinating to get to know. There is so much love and passion put in every frame it's palpable. And the music!! Oh god the music, the score is spectacular, Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts are genius! I never gravitated towards jazz but this score had me hook, line and sinker. 
I just didn't get it. I didn't get why I was supposed to care, I didn't understand. Maybe I started the series too young and my own personal maturity wasn't high enough to read deeper and not have the meaning spoon fed to you. This is what I ended up liking the most about Cowboy Bebop, it really is what you make it. There is meaning where you decide to hold meaning, it's about the past and the future and our own relationships and how life can be such a heavy burden. But it can also just be a Sci-Fi space Cowboy show. I think revisiting this show while I was about to wrap up college felt so much more poignant because I could understand the feeling of being pulled forward into adulthood but still being swept up by the past and my last few moments in college with little responsibilities and so many friends. And even then, I still left the series for a bit and have just now returned to it to watch the last four episodes this week finishing the series last night. Regardless of how long it took me to watch in the end I was so profoundly moved by this series I almost regret taking so long to watch the series. Almost.
I couldn't tell you why it took me so long to finish the series, maybe because I hate goodbyes and throughout the entire run there is a nagging feeling of loss and goodbyes are ever present, even from the first episode and the famous tagline of ""see you space cowboy"". Maybe that why. Maybe it's because I was too young and ""didn't get it"" or maybe it's because I wasn't enthralled enough to care. But this show has wormed it's way into my brain and I've been carrying it around with me in the back of my mind for years. So if you have made it to the end of this long winded review, give it a try. Who knows how you might feel. I do think it is worth the time, no matter how long that time may be, to sit and enjoy the ride. If it takes you a few days or even a few years, you'll be in good company.",9,TemporarilySalty,

                I'm not particularly good at writing reviews but I felt like I needed to for this show. I am also new to the anime community so my experience with the genre is very limited but this was honestly one of my favorite shows of all time, let alone favorite anime. 
The artwork is something that caught my attention from the beginning and is what kept me intrigued throughout the entirety of the show. 90s animation style makes me feel some type of way. From the fight scenes to the facial expressions when the characters talk to each other and everything in-between, the artwork was outstanding.
                  It was amazing to see how much they were able to create and how well it was created considering the time period.
Moving to the sound, I think the ""3...2...1 Let's Jam!"" is one of the most iconic lines in a soundtrack ever. Further, the creators somehow made Western music work for a show about space bounty hunters... never did it seem out of place!
Next, the four main characters... all incredible. Spike is everything you want in a badass main character and partnering with his rational sidekick (if you will) Jet, the duo is out of this world (literally). The addition of Faye added a nice balance for Spike's personality, hence why they fought a lot. The fighting was definitely not forced nor did it take anything away from the characters, it actually added a lot when you find out why both of their personalities are extremely combative. Finally, you could always count on Ed and Ein for a good laugh. At first Ed kind of annoyed me, but I was pleasantly surprised with her character development and the show wouldn't have been the same without her.
I left the story for last because I am stuck between wishing that there was more than 26 episodes to flesh out the story better or being content because the creators revealed as much of the story as they needed to. Throughout the show, I felt as if they could have fleshed out a few of the side stories and other main plot points a bit better, but the culmination of the show still made sense and felt complete even without them. I could be wishing for this because I never wanted the show to end, but that is the reason why I am not giving the story a 10, like the rest of the ratings. 
Overall, I highly recommend this show to anyone who watches and loves anime and I would even go as far as recommending it to anyone who has never seen anime in his life, that is how good this was.",10,washedwhale26,

                Please take my review with a grain of salt as it took me about a month to watch the whole thing.
~
Yet another show to cross off my list of ""cult classic"" animes. As expected of a show that shares the same director as Samurai Champloo, the pace and flow of the anime was fluid in its nonchalant transition between each episode and distinguished during. The overall story didn't matter as much as each individual event and this is where some of the artistry lies in this type of storytelling. It allows the viewer to be active in the moment and not anticipating the future or
                  dwelling on what happened in the past. In fact, every event seemed very real in its impromptu and freestyle...style (of course, just like jazz..). Nothing goes according to plan. Nothing happens to develop the story further on. Nothing is orchestrated for this ultimate grand scheme. Everything just happens.
--THIS SECTION ON CHARACTERS BECAME WAY LONGER THAN EXPECTED, SKIP IF YOU ALREADY DECIDED TO COMMIT THE TIME TO READING THIS--
The characters were all exciting. Relatable by their individual sins and mannerisms. Jet who reluctantly (yet willingly) supports his partners when he could be saved the headache by ditching them. Spike who personifies the Bruce Lee mantra of ""Be like water"". Faye who similarly throws caution to the wind and loses it all in gambling. And Ed who, after acknowledging her technological gift, could not be described more accurately than as the epitome of any lackadaisical child ever born. 
It begs the question of why a character should be stagnant on the spectrum they reside in. Should protagonists always be likable? Should antagonists always be detested? It is not easy to make a character who fluctuates in personality in a way that doesn't seem targeted or intentional. So we commonly see in a lot of modern day writing (not necessarily a majority, mind you) that good guys are good and bad guys are bad. 
I constantly became frustrated with each characters despite my previous acceptance of their flaws. But I could say the same of my closest friends and I'm sure they could say worse of me. At the end of the day, no matter their mistakes, mischief, or misconduct, characters should be as complex as the people we love and hate.
--END UNINTENTIONAL LECTURE--
The music was very good. I, for one, have a hard time sustaining a long term imprint from musical scores so forgive me if I can't provide a more structured opinion on it. I can at least tell you that I enjoyed it very well and all of it, of course, was in good taste.
The art and animation were incredible. Specific background arrangements and positioning were important. Beautiful landscape shots. Dynamic choreography and animation from hand to hand and gun fights. (Sounds pretty copypasta from my Champloo review?) Everything seemed painstakingly thoughtout and not for a moment did they consider half assing a single frame. Well.. except for the time they used a 3D model, but hey, maybe it seemed really damn cool in 1998.
All in all, I am simply another brick in the wall supporting this house of Bebop.",10,WaruiBui,

                Cowboy Bebop is a true classic. The perfect story, characters and sound from 1998 imagining the future of late 2000 century. This is one anime that everyone should take time to watch and enjoy.
Let's start with story. It was truly unique and felt pure. For many 2020s animes they kinda don't have the purity or realism that Cowboy Bebop or other older classic have with their stories. Simply it is story about cowboys (bounty hunters) hunting criminals in futuristic space world. And I don't care much for space stuff, I kinda get bored by it.  But this anime has the most coolest and interesting
                  story. I wanted to know every characters and every detail. I was nervously waiting every episode what would happen because it was so interesting. 
For the artstyle I would say it is very 90s anime style. But I just love how the characters look, move and do such a small things. It feels very detailed and good quality. And the space backgrounds and different worlds were so amazing. 
The music in Cowboy Bebop was really good, so many good songs. Many of them were English but it didn't sound weird because the characters were inspired by 1800 bounty hunters and 1950s gangsters. I liked Fayes design even though boobs didn't make sense, but the design was too cool.
The characters were so good. They all had backstories, character development and personalities. Every character was unique in their way and you will find something that you like in every single one of them. (mines was Spike and Faye).
I fully enjoyed this series. I just can't handle that I finally watched this, I want to watch it again. It gives me so much serotonin! I recommend to everyone watch this anime, this is a true classic!
few opinions:
There are few character designs that may annoy some people (lgbt). Because there a few times possible transwomen in Cowboy Bebop. And they are shown having male characteristics and beards, because they are ""men"". And for someone like those amab characters the man must be gay. :/
But at least there was genderfluid representation with one character (in same episode.)",10,Ruskatuska,
1,"
                I am not export nor know anything professionally about Anime. I don't care about how good the plot is, how amazing the music is, and how fine the animation is made. The thing that Cowboy Bebop gives to me is emotional resonance. 
I feel what characters feel. I remember many scenes from it as part of my memories. They have never faded away even after 20 years. On the opposite, memories and feelings of Cowboy Bebop get more and more profound as I get older. 
I have heard some people say that Cowboy Bebop is overrated. It is never the case to me since there
                  is no other anime that could make me think of them in daily life. No other anime could let me feel deeply about myself, humanity, and the universe. Cowboy Bebop likes a mirror or a vibe of my emotions.",10,urgendalai,
1,"
                Writing a review because I did not expect this anime to have much of an impact on me, yet here I am, carrying the weight of it.
I think the charm of the series is that it creeps up and sticks with you without you even realizing it. The first few episodes were fun enough -- the art and the music never disappointed, and while I was slightly surprised at first, I had been lulled into being content with what seemed to be a solid episodic space western. At that point, I thought that the anime would stay just like that -- the normal recipe of
                  slightly quirky characters, quests/problems wrapped up in an episode, and the occasional deep insight. 
It was only in the latter half of the series that I realized how attached I've become to the Bebop crew, and how effective the past episodes were at building up their stories and characters so naturally that I didn't even realize that certain things were plotpoints. What makes Cowboy Bebop different from a lot of animes is that it's subtle about its story -- instead of shoving it in your face, it makes you learn about it through bits and pieces from each episode, so that by the end, you have an idea of what everything implies. No wonder people watch and rewatch this show (I'm certainly considering it).
Also, amazing art and music to the very end. I can never stress this enough.",9,karasunohs,
1,"
                When I was getting back into anime it was hard to know where to start, so I figured I'd go with the classics. I cued up Cowboy Bebop along with a few others and finally got to watch the show that so many consider to be an unrivaled masterpiece... and I just don't get it.
My theory is basically this. The only reason this show is so popular has nothing to do with it's content, and everything to do with the availability of anime in the west. Back in the day there wasn't any such thing as streaming, you wanted a show you either waited for
                  some American company to dub it or you learned Japanese and bought from the source. Even pirating subbed anime was difficult considering it was a time of dial-up speed internet and there were very few groups ripping the VHS tapes to make fan subs. Official subs didn't really become a thing until streaming services came around and Japan finally realized there was an audience in the west that they could market to.
Anyway, all this to say  that if you were a weeb in the 90's there weren't a lot of shows around to even watch. I don't even know how you'd go about becoming a weeb in the first place in such a landscape. It was probably mostly the internet imageboards, the places where the term weeb originated, that had people who cared anything about anime. So it is that Cowboy Bebop is held up in high regard by these people as being some great masterpiece when in reality it was just the best they could get their hands on.
Now I'm not going to be disingenuous and say I hated the show just to be contrary. I didn't hate it. I just don't understand it. It was a decent sci-fi story with solid animation and a crew of interesting characters. It's a good show, but I have none of the rose tinted feelings for it that someone who got into anime by watching this show might have. So I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 space cowboys.",8,lamaraptor,
1,"
                ""Cowboy Bebop"" inspired me to write my first review, and it should already mean a lot! 
This anime is really something special (No sarcasm!). It took me 3 times to start watching. You should really be in a specific mood to enjoy it. The first episode seemed a little messy and overwhelming, but it all started to make sense as the story moved on. 
""Cowboy Bebob"" is definitely a work of Art. You don`t even need to like all the space setting to realize that this anime was made by very talented and inspired people, who really put their heart and soul into it. Some
                  scenes are so aesthetically pleasing, you will want to rewatch them over and over again, they are just perfect. 
And music of course! Who would have thought that jazz will go so well with all ""bounty hunters in space"" topic. But it does! There are some great music themes and songs in anime, but in ""Cowboy Bebob"" music plays a very special role. I can even say it is as much a character as any of the Bebob crew. And the famous opening, of course. It`s definitely a ""never skip"" one.
Fight scenes and space battles are beautifully made. I was watching all of them with bated breath (and rewatching them several times).
What I personally didn`t like very much were the episodes about the heroes` past. I don`t expect the characters not to have a past, of course, but to my taste they were a bit over dramatic, in a ""film noir"" style (which was definitely the authors` idea, since they were playing with different genres of American films). It`s just that I personally like the comedy and adventure episodes more.
So, all in all, Cowboy Bebob is no doubt a remarkable series, which is worth watching!",9,BirdieBrave,
1,"
                ok so cowboy bebop is incredible and i truly believe it's the greatest anime of all time.
it's a bittersweet story about the ways that each character's past affects them and the ways that they choose to handle it, whether it's to run away from it, ignore it, or to desperately try to run back to it.
most of the show is what i suppose you could call filler episodes, but i'd argue that they're just as important as the episodes that contribute to the actual plot. every episode contributes to each character's development in one way or another and helps you grow to love the show's
                  main characters. the episodic nature of the show makes it easy to take your time with the show and take it one episode at a time and each stand alone episode leaves you waiting for the next time the main plot comes back in and there's always a sudden feeling of dread when you see ""(part __)"" next to an episode title because you just know it's going to get depressing.
the show itself has beautiful art that makes you feel nostalgic even if you've never watched older anime. it has beautiful backgrounds and really cool character designs.
the soundtrack to this show is absolutely flawless paired with an iconic opening. it really is one of the best soundtracks i've heard. also it has an incredible dub cast to the point that even thinking of watching it in japanese feels like a waste.
every single main character in this show is likeable and complex. spike is likely in my top 3 characters of all time. the female characters in the show are both well written, which is unfortunately a rarity. the characters in cowboy bebop are also essentially quote machines, constantly pumping out iconic quotes and sayings that just seem to stick with you.
as i'm writing this i'm rewatching the show and i'm up to a specific part toward the end where spike and jet are eating eggs (which had been cooked for 4) alone, that's pretty much it, though it sounds like a dumb scene there's a fuck-ton of emotion behind it which i think perfectly displays cowboy bebop's impeccable ability to show rather than tell.
ontop of all of that cowboy bebop has a flawless ending that perfectly ties up loose ends whilst still making you feel empty inside for the next couple weeks or so.
the overall rating of 10/10 really isn't shocking after i begun the review calling it the best anime of all time, but it really is, and if by now you still haven't watched by now it you're seriously missing out.",10,5P4C3-C0W80Y,

                Okay so I feel obliged to write up a review on my favorite animated space western of all time, Cowboy Bebop. I am not alone in that this show is widely acclaimed by many others as well. The moment I watched Bebop, I expected so much from anything I've watched since and not a lot can live up to Bebop, if any.
Story: 10
So basically you have your main character Spike and his bounty hunting partner Jet Black patrolling the galaxy on their ship, the Cowboy Bebop. Along the way they pick up Faye, a woman with hardly any recollection of her past, Ein the smart
                  Welsh Corgi, and Ed, computer whiz. The plot of the story is different from many other fictional works; Bebop's plot isn't a core component of the show. It's all about how all of the characters develop over time. I'll talk about the characters in a little bit.
Art: 9
Still a somewhat older anime (19 years old sheesh!) but the art holds up from its debut. Still feels lively and more aesthetically pleasing than its counterparts over those couple of years but would be criticized if it were created today.
Sound: 10
I would rate it a 20 if I could. One of the best dubs ever? Check. A fucking amazing OST? Check. All time classing opening? You can honestly just label this as one of the best musically crafted shows not only in anime but in movies and TV as a whole. Any music fan questioning whether they want to watch anime for the first time must start with this show.
Characters: 10
The main characters are all different and each have an in depth backstory carefully woven into the series. The main villain, Vicious is only in there for like 3 episodes and he still feels like a really important character in the series. If you believe in a silhouette test, this show literally has it in the opening and it definitely passes with flying colors.
Enjoyment: 10
If I weren't pressed for time when I started watching it, I would have watched it in one go. 8-9 hours straight of Bebop is just amazing in my head.
Recommendation: 
Watch the show. If you're a hater wanting to find a bad review, watch the show. New to anime? Watch this. You've already watched Bebop and want to find other like-minded individuals? Watch it again. Also, listen to the whole OST on YouTube, shit is amazing to listen to during any circumstance.",10,swilldell,

                Cowboy Bebop is a perfect anime in every way, Spike Spiegel is a memorable protagonist, as are his companions too.  An incredible animation for the time, a wonderful story, in which the viewer can watch almost all the episodes in the order they want, and the soundtrack is perfect.
Seeing Cowboy Bebop chronologically shows you a better development of the main characters, all of them are linked to the past in some way and this holds them in their own mind, at the end of the plot, we get to see everyone finally overcoming their past and being able to move on with their lives
                  (depending on how you look at it).
 Watching Cowboy Bebop non-chronologically also has fun watching the random adventures of a group of bounty hunters.
Another important point to highlight in the anime is the issue of the shaman, which is shown in several parts throughout the animation, it is important to remember a phrase that is said at the beginning of the anime about the men of the earth becoming stars when they die, after the final scene of the anime, we don't know what happens to Spike Spiegel, but we see a star rise to the sky, and from that, each one with its own conclusion.",10,rosivjr,
1,"
                Despite my limited exposure to the anime medium, I full-heartedly believe this piece of art is an anime masterpiece. It famously crosses several genres, it has amazing music, animation, and a creative, unique atmosphere.
I watched Firefly as child, and I loved watching this anime as an adult, as I'm sure it heavily inspired the Serenity universe. 
Personally, the jazz and songs like ""Blue"" were a joy to listen to.
A reminder to all those watching, pay attention to final salutations at the end of every episode, they carry a lot with them, and really cement the creator's intended mood and emotion of each episode. 
The themes
                  explored in the visually beautiful show are truly the centerpiece of the creator's vision for the show. I'm sure with each viewing, and the more time spent with Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed, Ein and their various acquaintances and bounties along the way, we can all learn a little more about our own personal outlook on our past and choices we make, especially as we age and grow wiser. 
I did not watch this show in the 90's, however I am a child of the last decade of the millennium, and I'm grateful that such an iconic show set in the future is also, so obviously, a product of that time. What I'm attempting to say, is that It's nostalgic science fiction for me, personally.
This is an episodic show, and I didn't feel the urge to binge watch as I tend to do with most anime. I'm not sure why this was the case, perhaps because I knew of this anime from before I truly knew anything about anime. I knew it was a classic, and was in no hurry to finish. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and felt truly moved at the end of several episodes. In the cases of the lighter episodes, I always ended with a big smile on my face. 
PS I watched subbed. I hear good things about the dub. I've seen the clips, and would agree the casting seems excellent. For me though, it is still off putting to watch dubs, and don't see myself rewatching with the dub because it's too distracting.",10,rattrapwasright,

                Cowboy Bebop is renowned as one of the finest anime's of all time, and for good reason, it's world, story and characters are so engaging and it's all multiplied by masterful direction from Shinichirō Watanabe, as well as a beautiful art style and musical score from Yoko Ono and seatbelts.
Within the first episode of cowboy bebop you're instantly enticed by it's unique visuals and stunning world, it's characters have depth that will take the entire series just to touch the tip of the iceberg in terms of exploration into their pasts, motives and ideology, the characters have such morbid and somber backstories yet they're full
                  of life that keep you smiling all the way through the show with their constant banter and bickering with one another. It's lead villain 'Vicious' reminds of Sephiroth from Final Fantasy VII, not just because of his appearance and choice in weaponry but more about the fact he has so much presence in his rather minimal screen time (compared to the rest of the cast), due to his heavy emotional connection to Spike and other characters throughout the show. Cowboy Bebop has imagery and aesthetic you cant find anywhere else, it's blend of sci-fi and noir crime simply cant be found anywhere else of this high quality, this is one negative i had with Cowboy Bebop's movie, as it lacked that blend of sci-fi and noir for majority of it's runtime, and one of the main reasons the series of so good is due to it's unique blend of two very different genre's and aesthetics, it's colourful yet bland, light yet dark in tone and it's truly an experience unlike any other, the show is a gripping adventure through a futuristic solar system full of crime, corruption, destruction and above all else...jazz.
Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack is one of the most beloved soundtracks of all time and for good reason, it brings so much life to the show, it's almost as if the show just wouldn't be the same without it's musical choice, the opening titles are simply iconic due to it's damn right masterful music and more incredible tracks can be heard all the way through this masterpiece.
The animation is clean as hell, the arial and hand to hand fights looks so fluent, a lot could of easily gone wrong when creating Bebop's complex fight choreography, but it all ended up fantastically due to a phenomenal job from Sunrise. The Japanese dub is still great but I urge each and every person to watch the show dubbed due to the English cast being perfect for each of the roles, with by far the greatest being Steve Blum as the protagonist Spike, which has implemented him as one of animations finest voice actors for his performance in Bebop Alone.
The pacing and runtime is simply perfect, it tells each of its episodical tales in such expansive detail in such a small 25 minute runtime (with 2 part special stories being seen twice in the show). It's kind of sad that anime has almost abandoned the story telling shows like Cowboy Bebop and Trigun went for, telling one single story in a single season instead of making many seasons which sadly mostly ends up in the show becoming bloated. Bebop has just the right amount of what it has to satisfy it's audience, not too little not too much in it's 26 episode length, I wish more creators would stick to this runtime as it will make it more accessible for people who don't want to watch hundreds of episodes as they simply don't have the time.
Cowboy Bebop is a show loved by so many across the world, and is one of the only anime's that I believe can be called a timeless classic, it will continue to be a gold standard in terms of anime series and I urge people who enjoyed the show to watch other anime's created by it's genius creator Shinichirō Watanabe.",10,Vjestiprime,

                Cowboy Bebop was about the second anime I ever watched.  I never could catch it all the time when it was on Adult Swim but thanks to online episodes and movie rentals I finally got to see it all about two years ago.  What caught my attention was the art.  The art is more real to life than some anime and really spoke to me.  The sound tract was great, I even hunted down and bought the OST.  The characters were unique and worked well together in the crazy futuristic setting.  The story was good over all and several
                  episodes stood out and re-watched many times.  All said it is a great anime and worthy of being called an anime classic.",9,firebug,

                Cowboy Bebop is a show that balances fantastic characterization through multiple episodic stories, has an intensely gritty and grimy sci-fi setting to match it's more grounded takes on sci-fi concepts, and has an incredibly thick and memorable atmosphere assisted by it's gorgeous visuals, set design, and it's highly acclaimed soundtrack. Most of what can be said about Bebop has already been said, but it's just a testament to how involved and interesting the themes and stories contained within this series are. It's unlike any other anime I've ever seen, and is something that I'd recommend to newcomers and anime aficionados alike.

                At first, I didn't like Cowboy Bebop. I found the art okay, the pacing to be slow, the episodic bounties to be boring. Spike wasn't very interesting, Faye was annoying, and Jet was okay. The only thing I really liked about it was the music.
However, closer to episode 10, I found it to be more interesting. Besides episode 11, which almost made me stop watching entirely, it just steadily got better and better, and I'm glad I kept going. Ed became more charming, Spike became more interesting, Faye got less annoying, Jet became more likeable. When the episode is actually tied to the main cast,
                  they're generally really good. It's the episodes that stand on their own and really have nothing to do with anything personal about the main crew that flop. 
If you're looking for a consistent plot throughout, then pick up a different series. But if you want some decent characters with a little bit plot occasionally interspersed throughout, give it a shot. It might surprise you. The sense of humor, for me, is fairly weak though. I can recognize when it's trying to be funny, but it never actually makes me laugh. But that's not what people watch it for.",8,thelivingtunic,

                Every once in a while something with staying power comes along.  That title that is spoken of with admiration for years afterwards because of how good it was.  Metal Gear Solid, Lord of the Rings, any of the great sci-fis from Trek to Firefly.  And among them, Bebop.
By some of you younger shithea--I mean fans, it's been called overrated.  But it was a benchmark for the kind of story Anime could tell two decades ago, and of those that have tried since, only a fraction can even compare.  The ex criminal, the ex cop, the femme fatale, the hacker and
                  the dog (who I swear is smarter than all of them), all drifting through space looking for the next job, or meal, or maybe just answers.
Part of what made it perfect was Yoko Kanno's musical expertise, ranging from roaring jazz band to somber blues harmonica to heavy metal, and many others.  You can't play any song from this series without recognizing it, even down to what episode it represents.  It was a sleeper hit turned gamebreaker, a story so well told it took forever to find someone who could do it justice (or so we hope) in adapting it.
If you don't know Bebop, you're lying.  Everyone KNOWS Bebop, some just don't appreciate it.  But I always have.

                no flaw in this show, perfect. I have to keep writing so imma talk more about it. The music is amazing has all kinds of music especially jazz. The music and visuals make a unique atmosphere that no other show has done, making it stand out. The story is driven by the outstandingly written characters that are so realistic they feel alive. You become attached to the characters and world and what will happen. The relations in the show drive the story forward. Its lifelike, showing the everyday problems that these characters face.

                Cowboy Bebop is a series I have been recommended time and time again by both anime watchers and casual fans. Is it as good as I was led to believe? Yes, it absolutely is.
Story: 9/10
Cowboy Bebop is an episodic series with an overarching plot that often moves forward in the background. Because of this, some episodes could straight up be considered filler. But it's the best kind of filler. The kind of filler that is so good, that you enjoy it too much to realize what it is. Each episode is entertaining from beginning to end, with my personal favorite being episode 21 (the atmosphere
                  is downright chill-inducing, easily one of the best individual episodes of anime I've ever seen).
Art: 9/10
Animation is gorgeous for its time and still holds up exceptionally well, even today. Fight scenes have fantastic choreography, and the visuals are rarely dull. The visualization of Ed hacking into things is a bit tacky, but still charming.
Sound: 10/10
The soundtrack enhances every aspect of the show. It is truly something else. Voice acting in both sub and dub is great (Kouichi Yamadera especially kills it as Spike in the original Japanese audio). Bebop's OP, Tank!, is one of the most iconic anime OPs of all time, and for good reason.
Characters: 10/10
Spike's cool, calm demeanor. The anger and bitterness of his foil, Vicious. Faye Valentine's knack for mischief. Jet's no-nonsense attitude. Ed's wacky gestures and speech patterns. These characters are icons due to the fact that they are massively entertaining to see on screen, combined with their simultaneous depth as well-rounded, believable human beings. Everyone has demons from their past, and Cowboy Bebop explores this idea masterfully. The characters of this show cannot be praised enough. To make things even better, Bebop also features Ein, the best boy in all of anime. If you weren't sold on the show already, THERE'S A SPACE CORGI.
Enjoyment: 9/10
I was a big fan of this series and I certainly will revisit it. Certain parts of the second half did drag a little bit, but this series is easily one of my favorites.
Overall: 9.25/10 (rounded down to 9)
Cowboy Bebop is considered a classic for good reason. I wouldn't go as far as to call it a masterpiece, but I certainly understand why some people would, and it is still a must-watch for anyone.",9,APerfectRoll,
1,"
                The story is set in a space western setting -  Spike and Jet, who own a ship called the Bebop. They travel the Solar system as bounty hunters, chasing wanted criminals to earn money. Along the way, they also pick up two women; the debt-laden Faye Valentine and the playful kid and computer genius Edward. Also a genius dog named ein.
Anway I am not a huge fan of the mosnter of the week formula, I prefer a stories to follow certain arcs, however not every episode in this story is a monster of the week. Those episodes are always good regardless, the reason why
                  I'm giving cowboy bebop an 8 is because its inconsistent. Some episodes like the last two episodes are ten out of ten, some are 7 outs of ten. the episodes focusing on the past of the main characters are good and a few individuals one-off episodes, but for me it isn't consistent enough to earn a ten.
Now let us talk about the characters
Bebop has a theme about the past and how you can't run away from it. All the characters in the ENTIRE SHOW are effected by the past. This includes the bounties they chase , who are running from the crimes they committed whether they did it for good reasons or bad.
Spike: Most obvious. He's running from his time with Vicious and the Red Dragons. He had to fake his death to escape his past, and his arc ends ""positively"" with him accepting his past and accepting death. I felt like I was watching a dream i never wake up from, before i knew it the dream was all over"" is a telling line of his. Yeah, basically one of the themes of the show, that he even talks about with Faye, is that it's useless to hold onto the past. You should let it go and live in the moment, freely.
Of course, he never lived by this advice himself. He's shown to constantly be held by the past and an inability to let go of Julia. He consistently takes off from the Bebop to go drink and think about things and lives in a state of lethargy because of his perceived loss. He finds Julia at the end of the series and when she's killed, he decides to spare the Bebop crew anymore attacks from the Red Dragon by confronting Vicious directly... He also does this to avenge Julia and bring an end to the cycle of living in the past and present at once.
Faye: Second most obvious. Her past is completely erased from her memory and she spends most of her time on Bebop trying to suppress her sadness with it by going to dog/horse races and drinking. When the VHS tape comes to her near the end of the show, she starts remembering more and more, until she finds her family home has been torn down and she has no memory of it outside of the video tape. Her arc ends negatively, accepting that she'll never have those memories back.
Jet: Least obvious. Jets glory days are behind him, and he left behind a successful job as a police officer (after being set up for a fall by his partner) and the love of his life who left him because she felt too dependent on him. He never had the family he wanted so he tries very hard to make a family out of the Bebop crew. He loves Ed, thinks of Spike as his brother, he is the only member outside of Ed that interacts regularly with Ein, and at least tolerates Faye. Jet's arc is a lot less dynamic than Spike and Faye, probably because he's supposed to be the moral center that drives Spike's story, but he's an old man past his prime.
Ed is a lot less dynamic that Spike and Faye for obvious reasons, but Ed's father was never very attentive to Ed and left Ed in an orphanage because he couldn't keep them around while working his intense job as an Earth cartographer. The Bebop crew, Jet excluded, doesn't care for Ed and disregards them often.
Ed's past is about rejection, and Ed seems (I say seems because Ed never speaks clearly about themselves in the show lol) to come to the acceptance that they like being alone, and the family they made on Bebop isn't what they need. Ein comes along of course because they are best friends (And because Watanabe needed to jettison Ed and Ein before the climax) but Ed finds solace in being alone. Ed's arc ends in their last episode when they write Goodbye across the bow and venture across Earth finding new weird shit to do.
Vicious: It sounded like Vicious wanted Spike to come back to the syndicate, perhaps be partners once more during their confrontation at the church.
Just before spike was pushed out the stained glass window, Vicious was furious when spike told him that he put past behind him.
Perhaps Vicious was planning on having spike be a part of syndicate once he succeeded with the coup. Then again he did kill Mao. Everyone was waiting for Spike to return, perhaps Vicious wasn't an exemption.
The whole scene is great from start to finish. It's the first time they've seen each other in years, since Spike left and had his near brush with death. We can only speculate what their relationship was like before everything but with the brief flashbacks during Spike's fall they appeared to be very close friends. They most likely had very similar childhoods (lack of parents being around/never there to begin with) poor struggling to survive on the streets of Mars. Then Mao comes along and sees their potential in the syndicate and takes them under his wing, becoming the closest thing they've had to a father/family. From then until Spike leaves they were probably constantly working together(definitely some friendly rivalry trying to one up each other) becoming like brothers, the first time I watched that scene when Vicious talks about them sharing the same blood I thought they were actually brothers. Now I realize he meant it symbolically. I think Vicious feels betrayed by Spike and I agree I think Vicious wanted him to come back and be his number 2. Then again Vicious may have wanted to just kill him to eliminate the threat. Little is known about Spike's past and even less of Vicious's so its hard to say...",8,Lordsunlight,

Cowboy Bebop is a show that aired before I was born. Yet to this day, it manages to hold up as one of the greatest anime of all time. Although skeptical at first, eventually I came to understand why it is revered as such and why I now believe it is a must-watch for anime lovers and haters alike.
TL;DR at the bottom.
I personally use my own rating scale- for more info on that, the values and variables are on my profile. That being said, let's dive in.
ART: 2/2
Though, at the time of writing this, Cowboy Bebop aired twenty-two years ago, somehow the art manages
                  to still be captivating and enticing. The style is extremely unique, the landscapes are vocal and paint each scene well, the animations are fluid, and the characters are recognizable anywhere.
SOUND: 2/2
A classic, incredibly popular opening. Possibly one of my favorite ending themes ever, as well. The usage of background music within the anime was also strong and very well set up different moments.
STORY: 4/4
Cowboy Bebop is episodic. Aside from a couple crucial episodes near the beginning and end, the anime can honestly be watched from any random point and still be enjoyable. This gives it incredible rewatch potential, and all the same it still manages to have meaningful underlying plot and backstory. This show is the definition of ""less is more"", managing to pull off what many anime fail to do in multiple seasons with just a few hints and scenes.
ENJOYMENT: 1/1
I was not bored for a single moment throughout this entire show. No matter how wacky, absurd, or ridiculous an episode was, I was always invested in the plot and characters presented.
PERSONAL NOTE:
Though not a personal favorite, what defines Cowboy Bebop as a must-watch is the fact that it is not only incredibly unique, but also filled with valuable and memorable lessons that you will not see elsewhere. After finishing this show I sat still for an hour simply in thought. I sincerely believe that Cowboy Bebop is beneficial for individual development.
FINAL THOUGHTS / TLDR:
Cowboy Bebop wholly lives up to its reputation, and will still manage to hold up as a great for many years to come. It is not lacking in any category whatsoever, and is a must-watch whether or not you are an anime fan. The anime is incredibly unique, the lessons learned are impactful, and the cast and world is lovable. Do yourself justice and watch this anime.",9,ryukifire,

                Motivated by the legendary composer, Yoko Kanno, I’ve finally finished this classic series. I must say that I am not a big fan of the space and cowboy theme and not to mention the stand alone episodes, however, I can completely understand why this is a classic to people who are into this genre. Nevertheless, subjectively, I would give the majority of its success to Yoko Kanno’s compositions which govern the entire comedic and melancholic atmosphere of Cowboy Bebop. I’d have to say this is Kanno’s best compositions after Ghost in the Shell SAC. The music and atmosphere also reminded me of Michiko & Hatchin
                  - with attempts to portray comedic and sorrowful struggles for the characters while reaching their goal.
While I do appreciate the characters and the humor, I felt that the plots were not particularly exciting or unique - it seemed to me like a bad mix of Lupin the Third and Ghost in the Shell SAC, and I’d prefer Fujiko Mine over Faye Valentine any day. I’d love to see more of Ed’s hacking in action, even though deep down I know it’s going to be a disappointment compared to the goddess, Motoko. 
There was also not much character development throughout the series. Spike started out quite interesting, but his character remained constant throughout as with the others, whom all lacked substance, which made them all rather blend. This definitely created the my dissonance between the anime. I also found the worldbuilding and visuals to be predictable and what one would “expect” of futuristic planets. To me, they are not artistic, visually striking or novel, but I can understand how this would fascinate others with less aesthetic expectations. 
Regardless of the suboptimal plot and characters, I’d have to say the Saul Bass inspired opening is my favorite opening in all of anime. No matter how many times I watch it, it’s so appealing while being the perfect match to the music - absolutely sexy and stylish. It is probably the only anime which I have watched all of the opening without skipping to the main story - really quite exquisite! 
All in all, not one of my favorites. Just watched it to enjoy Yoko Kanno’s music.",5,reizamundi,

                This anime is a very good watch. The dub was excellent. 
It isn't perfect, but I can see why it is a classic. Personally watching this got me back into anime after a long hiatus. I think where this anime excels is in the art and the soundtrack (very memorable). The setting itself is very cool, and the background art is exceptional.
As for the story, some of the episodes are very thrilling. Where it disappoints is the overall plot arc. The main antagonist is very boring, I just wasn't interested in the conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist. This can be forgiven since the
                  show isn't one of those that you need to watch from the start anyway, some of the episodes are great standing alone and most episodes don't really follow that arc. For context, a lot of the side-villains are way more interesting. 
It isn't the holy grail some make it out to be, but it is a very good anime IMO. Eye-candy and ear-candy. Pretty thrilling but not always.",8,JazzCabbage,

                Soundtrack was obviously a masterpiece! Production was worth watching. To compares with these day anime, this is really great motion picture. I just noticed that in most action scenes they only put on sound effects of smashing, crashing, bomb but not ""arrrrrrh""/ ""ouchhhh""/ ""yaaaa"" or anything like that ( just felt odd because currently anime has it significantly). One thing I wanted more in this show is to give us more information about backstory of Spike and the organization. It was said from very first episode but gone for long time and come back again at the final episode which made me felt at a
                  loss. But overall it was a one of legendary anime of all time for me.😋",9,joy_swifty,

                Cowboy bebop is a magical experience that you don't fully appreciate until it's over. The nature of the show is odd but is executed so perfectly, the many adventures and characters we see and all thoughtfully and carefully put into the story to address something related to the main cast. Saying I love this show is an understatement, it was the show that got me into anime; I still chase that high I got from it the very first time watching it. Well written, well thought out, and perfectly executed is what this show is. It's seems like a love letter to me personally, this
                  is because it discusses some of my favorite themes, the older I get the more I understand what it means and the more I appreciate it's colorful and authentic explorations and tragedies. A wild mix of genres and settings with insane adaptability makes this one of my favorite shows of all time.
The storys is shrouded by mystery it leaves you in the dark, give you very little information and when it all ends it leaves you with wanting more. However, as interesting and complex the main story may be the real star when it comes to the story telling is the episodic nature of the show and how in every episode we get a new and unique story that fills you with an odd sense of dread, re-watching the show many of these stories are reflections of the main cast and how they live with their past. Every episode is meaningful and takes you on a journey in a new part of the world. The world building is also fantastic, it's set in this dystopian space society in the future where earth is beyond repair and just a junkyard, the world reflects the atmosphere of the planets they visit very well, for example, Earth feels like home, a place to contemplate, and a place where past and present is linked. In contrast Venus is the sister planet to earth, it's being rebuilt and taken care off environmentally which seems tragic and ironic but that describes episode 8, the episode set in Venus, perfectly. Ironic and Tragic. 
The art is fantastic, the first thing I noticed is that it's very visually appealing if you need an example watch up to episode 5. The colors used always reflect the tone of the show perfectly, the art style makes the goofiness of the show apparent, and the design of personal belongings reflect their characters very well. My favorite example of the use of color and tone in the show is episode 6, at the very end with 'Wen' and how the red colored background contrasting the black soil that seems decomposed and used works so perfectly with the harmonica being played adds so much impact to what happened. In addition the shows artistic style also helps them portray powerful foreshadowing and symbolism, with the use of objects, colors, and stories pay attention to episode 17 and you'll understand what I mean. 
Sound in this show is the driving theme behind everything, take one listen to the Cowboy Bebop OST and you'll be hooked and engaged with 20 different genres of music and tracks so good it will make you want to watch this show all over again, this time paying attention to the placement of these songs and their significance. From the Starting theme of 'Tank!' to the amazing blues and jazz we hear throughout the show, music is the constant in a show that changes every single episode. Even the titles of each episode are based off a classic song. Many of the songs in the show are jazzy or blues heavy songs that reflects the tragic trend of the show, and every single song is intentionally and carefully placed to set a mood or tone. I don't know where to start nitpicking these songs and their meanings to the stories but  I recommend watching episode 11 and the final two episodes of Bebop. I think the silence in episode 11 is excellent because it sets the episodes tone as calming, and the final two episodes use the blues to set a tragic and depressing tone. 
The character of bebop whether it's the villain, a character we see once, or the main cast all have thought and detail put into them. They are carefully crafted to look as they act; to be physical embodiment of their stereotypes. The main theme in Cowboy Bebop is the passage of time and how our past affects us. Every single character introduced has a troubled past they are attempting to cover or escape, they deal with the past by indulging in substance abuse, gambling, killing, etc... it shows you how when there's something holding you back you need to cut it before it is the end of you. Emptiness is also a major theme, how time passes by you and now you're a hundred years old with nothing valuable that you remember. However, I believe the more I watch Bebop the more I get out of it, with age i'll find something new that will have significant meaning to my life. Through the diversity of the characters, settings, stories, and the show itself it really allows someone to nitpick details and themes that might influence you at different stages of your life. It's an introspective journey through the galaxy and your mind, and everyone will draw a different meaning from Cowboy Bebop
This show has a good dub, what the fuck world do we live in. How is this show so perfect, watch it for yourself. ""The work, which becomes a new genre itself, will be called Cowboy Bebop."" Bebop is a masterpiece in setting tone; the music, story, character design, themes, and settings work together so well. If there was one anime I think everyone should watch it's this one.

                Man, I never knew anime OPs could be so hard to play on the recorder. This is sad.
So aside from the enraging recorder playing Cowboy Bebop is solid. I started watching it a really long time ago and remembered thinking that it was really cool. It was pretty high on the list for best anime with the #26 position, so I had a lot of high hopes. And while it wasn't quite as amazing as I had hoped, it was still pretty solid.
Let's start with positives. The story is pretty creative. I mean, the intermission of every episode pretty much tells you what the creators
                  are trying to do. And while they didn't quite manage to create a ""new genre"", they still made some pretty memorable moments. The fight scenes are fun and it goes without saying that the soundtrack is legendary. I also love that 90's voice acting that sounds so different from anime nowadays. The characters are all really fun. Jet, Spike, Faye, Ed, and even Ein are fantastic and are so much fun to watch. I enjoyed most of the show for these reasons.
However, there are a number of problems I have with this anime. The story is REALLY confusing for a lot of the time. I don't get the whole thing with Vicious and Spike and their lasting vendetta. The ending is also weird. The animation isn't always smooth and the style isn't super unique for its time. There are a few tracks that I don't like or I feel are out of place and in terms of characters Ed can be REALLY annoying. Also, I just found a large portion of everything boring.
Overall Cowboy Bebop is fine. I get why people would give it a 9 or a 10 but I just wasn't feeling it when watching the show. I thing it's quite overrated. That #27 spot should really go to another anime and this one should be knocked down a bit. That being said, it's still a good anime and I think you'll probably enjoy it for a number of reasons. Feel free to watch it and enjoy the quirky fun that is Cowboy Bebop.

                Story - 8: Snapshots
Cowboy Bebop is a show about a group of weathered bounty hunters trying to scrape by in the lawlessness of space and occasionally confronting their past. Just like the themes of one's past, the show's format is also rooted in the past, back when each episode had to have a beginning and end to retain the attention of television viewers. This format certainly has its disadvantages along with advantages. It feels like the episodes that involve the main characters' pasts don't have a lot of weight because they have to conclude for the next episode where they basically go on a completely
                  different adventure. On the other hand, the ephemeral nature of each episode creates the sense that the world of Cowboy Bebop is huge, and exists beyond the screen. Everyone is living their own lives, and our protagonists only have a limited window to influence the lives of others. Spike's struggle to escape the syndicate is the closest thing to a recurring plot, but this thread is only mentioned in a handful of episodes or not at all. Still, I couldn't have asked for a more fantastic conclusion the the series as Spike ultimately settles his unresolved past.
Art - 10: Moody Vibes
Bebop looks beautiful hands down. While the 1998 animation just manages to hold up compared modern standards, the show thrives via incredibly atmospheric scenes captured through diverse lighting conditions ranging from vibrant, to sepia, to gray-washed. You FEEL each scene instead of being fixated on the quality of animation. Another point to mention is the incredible attention to detail. Look no further than the guns and machinery in the show. The animators went through the effort to put the manufacturer and model of each gun along with every groove on the weapon. A lot of design went into the machinery, ranging from to the bold design of the spaceships to the mechanical articulation we can see in various machines. Bebop uses a bit of CGI, which was very rudimentary in 1998 compared to what we have today, but it only uses it for animating backgrounds. This is actually done very well because in my opinion it separates the mundane quality of life on a planet to the etherealness of space.
Sound - 10: Fantastic
The music is on par with if not even more iconic than the visuals. Yoko Kanno is my favorite Japanese composer. I admire her ability to adapt to different genres while retaining her own quirky style. The soundtrack is heavily jazz-based with influences of blues and rock. If the OP doesn't have you feeling some type of way, I don't know what to say! Also try Walts for Zizi, a much calmer but melancholy piece. The vocals hit their mark perfectly as well, whether they are singing in English or Kanno's cute gibberish language. As for voice acting, this is basically the only anime that I will live and die by the DUB. The show is heavily influenced by American cinema, so it is no surprise that English works so well for our main characters and their often aloof one-liners. Some side characters that appear in single episodes have much spottier voice acting. This was 1998, after all, which makes it all the more incredible that they nailed the main cast. 
Character  - 8: The Past
The main characters are done way differently than other anime, more akin to film noir. Spike, Jet, and Faye have for the most part already lived out their major story arcs before the anime even begins, with a slight exception for Faye. We instead see our characters confront their past and discover what made them the way they are and how that affects the way they make decisions. Additionally, our main characters serve as anchors for minor characters that DO see significant character development. Ed and Ein are a bit of an interesting case. While they also have profound backstories that shaped the way they are, they provide a sense of goofiness and fun to the Bebop which would otherwise be too bleak. 
Enjoyment - 8: The Right Occasion
I absolutely adore Cowboy Bebop the the point where it is stylistically my favorite anime. Although, there is a time and place for Bebop. It's perfect to enjoy with a glass of bourbon on a lonely weeknight, before unwinding and going to bed. But the show is a bit too gloomy and depressing for me to watch with friends or during the middle of the day. I could praise the production quality for hours to come, but in the end enjoyment comes down to how something makes you feel.
Overall - 9: Nonchalant
In my humble opinion Bebop is the coolest anime ever created. It is such a whole package, and doesn't really care what you think about it. Bebop tells its story at its own pace and peaces out just when you want more. Admittedly it is not for everyone and many will be turned off by its seemingly nonchalant nature. But for those of us who enjoy it, Bebop captures a timeless mood that no other anime has been able to replicate.",9,shamoz,
1,"
                As much as it is a cliché to consider Cowboy Bebop the crème de la crème of what anime has to offer, I cannot refrain from doing so. Having re-watched it multiple times, likely around twenty, with the most recent being a few short days ago I feel as if though it is one of only a handful of anime to have such a high ""re-watch factor"" as I have yet to get bored of it while tackling the series again.
Cowboy Bebop serves as not only a great entry point for anime newcomers, making it a great intro for ""non-anime"" friends and family alike, but
                  also as a very solid new series for fans of anime that somehow have yet to watch it. I would dare say it is a flawless anime if not for a small handful of episodes, two in particular, that do very little to advance the story and feel like filler; a crime for a series this short. Overall, and perhaps this is bias, that also seems to have a purpose in providing a quick breather for the series, taking place before and after some emotionally heavier episodes. 
Newcomers shouldn't let the aforementioned flaw deter them however as the art direction, led by Toshihiro Kawamoto, is really a sight to behold. Every action scene is as smooth as silk while every would-be mundane sit-down and relax scene has enough going on to draw your attention forward. This is made all the better by the memorable and unique cast of characters created, again, by Toshihiro Kawamoto. 
The pinnacle of this anime, however, is it's sound design and music. The sound design makes all of the beautiful action scenes as well as movement in general believable with not a single missed or awkward sound that were commonplace flaws in Cowboy Bebop's contemporaries. The atmosphere and overall feel of the anime are elevated past 10 to 11 with what I personally consider the greatest overall soundtrack in any anime, composed primarily by Yoko Kanno and The Seatbelts. The genre blending of jazz, opera, blues, and a handful of various other musical genres with the science fiction cowboy space opera aesthetic of the art really elevate the series to something special; particularly as at the time of its release nothing had been done like it before. This all helps to set the mood, something few anime have been able to accomplish quite as well since. The overall tone of the show feels varied and thorough while somehow also not straying so far off center as to be off-putting.
Since its release many have attempted to emulate what made Cowboy Bebop so special, to varying degrees of success. By the end of this series' 26 episode run it will be easy to forget that it was so short. The complex stories of each main character, the art, the action, the music, and finally the payoff make this series a memorable one that has solidified itself as one of the greatest series in the medium.",10,Thebulkybard,

                Nineteen years ago, during the year 1998, a Space Western anime was released by the name of Cowboy Bebop, an anime that would go on to become one of the finest pieces of animation ever made. Adapted and completely redesigned from its manga counterpart, with direction by Shinichirō Watanabe, this 26-episode long, seinen neo-noir anime series would continue to astound fans of the medium for decades to come.
The episodes for the show tend to be very episodic in nature, usually in two-parts, with stunning fluidity from one space romp to the next. Even though most of the episodes are unrelated, there’s never a disjointed feeling
                  of randomness, or having any kinds of fillers simply to bulk out the serial. It all fits wonderfully. Everything just belongs, nothing more and nothing less. When we do have story-specific arcs, they are laced with emotional intensity and the complexities that go with having a past you’re not so fond of. There’s so much grey in between the black and white that each character is portrayed to be multidimensional and so much more than a pretty face, or an intellectual genius.
The chemistry between all of the members of Bebop is one of my absolute favourite elements. They are flawed as fuck human beings, with quirks that cause a lot of grating disagreements and vexing (for them, not the audience) interactions. Nonetheless, they all have a key component in common that holds them together like a dysfunctional family. No matter how many times they try to walk away, eventually they find themselves back home. This is realistic. It’s believable. It’s something to connect with. Some will have a much more intimate relation to it than others. It’s comforting.
As I mentioned earlier, the animation, regardless of being almost 20 years old, still holds up really damn well. The power is in the details, literally. There are so many details that went into establishing the environments within the series that the best way to describe it is breath-taking. Whether the setting is the interior (or even exterior) of a ship, space itself, planets with crumbling or bustling cities, the characters themselves and the expressions that they make—it’s all extremely astounding. These little soft lines and harsh curves with unique shades of red, blue, and orange all create the mood and tone for which makes Bebop a bonafide neo-noir experience.
Even with all of these awesome traits, none of it really means anything if you can’t look beyond the animation and the cast to see just how far ahead of its time Cowboy Bebop truly was.
It’s 1998 and gender roles are getting less defined. This show broke gender moulds back then, and it continues to do so in the modern age. You have women, beautiful women and average women and women from all walks of life in regards to race, ethnicity, etc., who are never judged for being just that. They are portrayed as very strong, independent ass-kickers. It didn’t matter if they were criminals, heroes, or in between somewhere. The women in the show are some of the most intelligent people, and it’s never questioned or treated like it’s some kind of phenomenon. Good examples of badass ladies include Faye Valentine, Julia, and a very special bartender who’s a good friend of Spike’s (name’s not given to avoid spoilers).
One of our main characters, Edward, is a teenage girl, but it’s rarely brought up. Hell, her name is Edward. People don’t really care if she’s a she. Ed is a genius and eccentric as all fuck, and quite androgynous. Her brilliance is what makes her a compelling character. Yes, some people do gander at her gender, but it’s more of a passing curiosity. Her ability to do what she does is never doubted or questioned because of her being a girl. Most of the doubt stems from her sensationally unique persona and young age. We have another character in one of the episodes that’s a hermaphrodite. While it’s a bit uncommon, it never becomes the focal point of who he is or what he does. He’s just another person in the galaxy who’s got his own burden to bear.
So, yeah, gender roles and our ridiculous pre-conceived notions of what gender means doesn’t mean shit in this anime. I fucking love it.
A more common motif in the series is the belief that you are always a master of your own choices and leader of your own fate. Life is something to do with what you will, which is clearly exhibited by the decisions taken by our motley crew of criminal hunters, especially as their pasts begin to surface and reveal itself. Allowing yourself to be held back by some predetermined ideals that you may not even believe in isn’t living. The idea of having “obligations” and that there’s always an inherent “right” and “wrong,” is utterly false in the grand scheme of things and don’t account for jack shit if you’re going to be miserable in the end. This motif is beautifully complimented and further ingrained by the music…
Something else that gives the series loads and loads of depth is… the music. I’m sure that anyone reading this review that’s already had a chance to watch this anime was probably wondering when I’d bring this up. Well, here it comes. Hold on to your butts, my friends.
Yoko Kanno is quite possibly one of the most brilliant composers of the modern age. Her work has made appearances in many anime serials across the board from Wolf’s Rain to Terror in Resonance and a few others; each one a magnificent and stellar feat of musical capacities. Yet, I don’t think she can ever really top what she’s accomplished with Cowboy Bebop.
The Seatbelts is the fictitious Japanese space jazz band led by Kanno. The name derives from how the performers wear seatbelts to be safe as they participate in some serious hard-core jam sessions. This band, put together by Kanno, is responsible for all of the music in Cowboy Bebop.
The styles of music utilised is enthrallingly diverse and ranges from straight big band jazz to blues, acoustic ballads, hard rock, and country to funk and electronic. Hip-hop and experimental compositional elements also make their appearances. Aside from sounding extraordinary, the music in and of itself speaks volumes of what the show is about. If you look at most, if not all, of these genres, they began during periods of history where a voice of rebellion needed to rise. It was a means for people to expel their frustrations at life and all of the bullshit that they had to endure. Blues is a very depressing genre, originally created to voice the hardships that came from slavery and oppression. Jazz became a significant boom during the 1920s when war was looming and young folks were forced to fight or choose a side; when a passionate desire for independence was boiling to its peak. This included the rise of women’s empowerment and freedom of choice.
Every genre used to create the tunes began as a fight against being oppressed and having severely limited rights, if you had any to begin with. The music was about growing up and facing your fears and your monsters, to make life what you wanted of it. These genres were all born out of necessity to have something powerful and positive to believe in; a way to share the pain so you could stop it from continuing onwards.
As I mentioned earlier, this theme is apparent in all four members of our cast—Faye Valentine, Jet Black, Spike Spiegel, and even Edward. They all had something they were fighting for and some strong personal beliefs that drove them to become the people that they became; changes that needed to be made so they could be the stronger, better versions of their old selves.
Cowboy Bebop has so much more to it than the few things I’ve mentioned in this insanely long ass review. To be blunt, I wish I could talk about all of them because that’s how much I loved this series. I’m so passionate about it and what it means and what it stands for. But if I chat about everything, then you guys may not want to pick it up (if you haven’t already). I know that hype can have a negative effect on me; look at how long it took me to pick up the series.
While I do regret not picking it up sooner, I’m supremely satisfied with the fact that I waited so long. The world is a terribly different place now than it was in 1998. Not only was I just a child, there honestly wasn’t much that I could’ve related to the show back then as there is now, at least for me as an individual watcher. Maturity aside, I feel like the messages that are shared so passionately and so brilliantly in this anime are far more superior and relevant in 2017 than they would’ve been in 1998. But the fact that is was made 20 years ago, just goes to show you how far ahead of its time it truly was, which further intensifies my love for the science-fiction genre, no matter the medium.
In conclusion, I want to make one thing very clear: Cowboy Bebop is what it is, is as powerful and as remarkable as it is, because everything fits together so nicely. If you remove even one small facet of the show, it would’ve fallen completely apart. The music, any one of the characters (including minor ones), the animation, the motifs—anything at all and it wouldn’t be a work of art. It’s complex and intricate because every single piece makes it so; they’ve all got their place. Lose a single one and you’ve got nothing but a mediocre space western. Details are what create a masterpiece, especially when they’re subtle and natural.

                You're a Gen Y or a Gen Z but your parent is a Baby Boomer and the only way they are going to watch anime and at the very least, understand one, is if you now show them Cowboy Bebop. They might hate it. They might love it. But, you did your part in at least, showing them this classic animated series directed by Shinichiro Watanabe. It's not just  Bebop's pop cultural references that they can see the magnitude of in it's story, but that this series has a soundtrack that pretty much surpasses any they've heard in the past. You can throw in
                  movie soundtracks, any various artist soundtrack for that matter too. This show has the greatest one of them all. With blended genres of jazz, rock, soul, and pop, Kano's music perfectly synchronizes with each story and is a complete cohesive piece of art separate from the show, just when casually listening to it in the car on your way home from work. Her renowned track ""Tank!"" sets the stage as the series opening and classic Jazz piece. An addicting fusion of Jazz and rock having shades of the old Lupin theme from the 80s. Both openings exercise a hyper-stylization of color with some 70s nostalgia to technicolor and the boom of american cinema when westerns began dying out and action cop thrillers took it's place.
The title  ""Cowboy Bebop"" doesn't suggest the Ying and Yang of some sort. Instead, this juxtaposition of archetype and genre seems random with a great deal of introspection attached to it, providing the viewer a lot of investigative work for digging deeper into a genre's old cliches, and discovering something far more human and 3-dimensional about it's main characters' flaws---magnifying this for the viewer to draw connections between cowboy and soul artist, between Bruce Lee and Dylan.
Bebop's world, on the surface, is one that viewers can greatly emphasize with. Civilization is now on Mars although, much of it's culture is not very different from the one that was lost before. Earth has been somewhat obliterated by debris---not entirely, with people still somewhat retaining it's old cultures, and yet faced with the interpersonal struggles that you and I constantly face each day. 
Starving bounty hunters live on earnings from their caught criminals---just as advertised. Their interactions with other characters from the past suggest to them answers for the present. We have our main characters: Spike, Jet, and Faye constantly question about why they still exist between the series most epic battles.
Fragmentation caused by a technology affects us more-or-less the same for as long as tradition is continually passed down and reiterated. A VHS tape from the 90s is now nothing more than some obsolete, priceless artifact stored in some second hand shop in a dark alleyway.
The series best episode ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"" centers on the backstory of Spike Spiegel and we get a clearer understanding that Bebop is not just a sunrise sci-fi with an over-the-top budget attempting to please it's crowd of Trek nerds. Bebop acts on one level as a love letter to a lot to 80s cyberpunk anime like Goku Midnight Eye and Space Adventure Cobra, the construction of Spike's character alone acts as not only a continuation of those from the past but as a more matured, 3-dimensional version of one. For instance, the eye that Goku gets in Kawjiri's anime was replaced with a fake, cyber eye that gave him control over a lot of scientific devices in the story and helping him defeat the bad guys. Spike has a similar characteristic though, their is a more human, realistic side to the outcome of his operation in how the eye affects him emotionally. The influence of Bob Dylan and Bruce Lee that went into the design of Spike truly separates him apart from these other rugged action heroes. And truthfully, the character Spike is simply a lot better than all of those action heroes in the 80s in general. Because this show is so well animated, it makes us want to learn more about Spike's haunted past and what caused his edge in the first place.
The other protagonists, Jet and Faye are very interesting as well with the construction of Jet being inspired by the song Black Dog by Led Zeppelin, and Faye Valentine inspired by the song ""My Funny Valentine."" They both seem to work well as supporting characters as they are more easily to crack than Spike is.

                A beautiful show.
A mediocre story, beautifully presented. It was the intro that made me want to watch the show, because there was no getting it out of my head. I am not a fan of lyrical song as an intro- and TANK! was just the anime intro I was looking for. Anyone watching the dubbed version might have no idea that this was an anime, because of how little this show contained the elements of a stereotypical anime. (NOT that I have watched a lot of animes, but it doesn't take a lot to figure out the cliches) 
Its story is not at all a
                  brilliant one, its just ""good"". Too many coincidences for comfort are shown. Did Spike just bump into a guy? Guess what- he's got a 4 million bounty!
The best of the show is in its ending. Doesn't make you cry, just leaves a hole in      your heart. BUT, the feels will hit only if you've bonded with all the characters and the show itself and slowly fall in love watching the late 90's animation. Its not for binging, its for watching about two episodes at a time and forgetting about it. A good paced anime is just what I needed, and I got what I asked for.",9,dafuqisanime,

                Any story can be judged by three categories. 
1. How you feel while watching it.
2. How you feel at the end of the show
3. How you feel about the show after some time of completing the show.
If it gets better with every step, it will be a very good show.
Every time you recall this show, you will realize that is much better than what you had thought of. You will find new details and will never get the feeling of overrating this show.
Cowboy Bebop follows a non-functional group of bounty hunters. It is one of the mature series which is entirely carried by the characters
                  and the music. 
It is not heavily Plot based, the plot is only used to further the characters, and when it clicks in, it really takes the anime to the next level. Even without the 5- episodes, which carry the main plot, the story is still an anthology type story that focuses on unique characters and explores human psychology. The story feels real, unlike many other shows.
Honestly, without spoiling much, this the only show which I have rated 10 till now. The only show with a plot which at first seems out of place but yet fits perfectly in the story. After watching so many anime, I still feel this is the best anime. The time in my life when I watched this might also be a factor. It might be a slightly different experience for you, but I think this will be one of the best anime you will ever see.",10,vedantk,
1,"
                So, Cowboy Bebop was one of the many animes, that everyone talks, or talked, or mentions time to time, and I thought, might as well give it a shot. And thanks Dog I didn't miss this title. 
Don't get me wrong, the story isn't any kind of extraordinary, it has quite a few filler episodes, I guess, that's every TV show's curse. But it's not the point. Cowboy Bebop combines together what at first glance looks like incompatable things: wild west thrill, space journey and ganster movies. You have: native americans, jazz and funk, bandits, corrupted society full of punks, countless criminals and headhunters (aka
                  cowboys). And that 20-30's USA aesthethic really blends in well with sci-fi elements. 
But what I think really keeps you watching is character depth. Every single character has a mysterious past, and that makes you want to uncover that and get the big picture. And to answer your question, yes, they do not fail at doing that. 
Overall, this is classic. I've recently started to explore the world of japanese animation, and if you're like me, this is a must-watch. It's really an important part of anime history. 
P.S.: On the side note, I gotta say, Cowboy Bebop looked and felt like Firely to me. If you don't know what this is, this is 2002 TV show (non-anime) broadcasted by FOX. So, if you feel like you want something really similar, check out that as well.",8,robozaec,

                Cowboy Bebop, so many memories are etched into my mind from back when I was a kid, though I was relatively young, watching the later episodes on Toonami was a great time. So surreal, tragic and adventurous. 
Story (9)
Fantastic story, one of which consists of a group ill-fit yet dynamic posse of bounty-hunters traveling though space. People may not like the overall sporadic stories within each episode (or the show itself). However, I found that the chain of events really captured the life of a bounty-hunter. This is described as (to me) people who lost their way, have nowhere to go and are trying to
                  make ends meet in a crazy universe. For me, the show describes a universe of lost belonging, where life is limitless but can be pointless. For this show's time, I believe the range of its adventurous characteristics sparks ones imagination, engrossing them to watch more. The show itself, like really, Cowboys in space, you don't get as original as that. The originality is perfect and I have no clue of any genre that can be as similar and execute this so well. I guess the most prominent message of this anime was how to deal with your haunting past. Everyone has some skeletons in their closet, but sometimes the past might be difficult to cope with. For this, I was really pleased.
Art (8)
For the art, I did not expect too much considering when this came out. I love how the art (at least to me) was reminiscent of the past, sort of hazy and incomplete. But the backgrounds were drawn out nicely, setting the mood for each scene perfectly (especially the later episodes). Because of this it flows with the concept of a surreal and curious past. But nonetheless, the art style was memorable and all the other aspects of the anime made up for some of lesser part of the animation.
Sound (9)
Let me just inform you that I watched the dub (because my inner child called for it). For a dub, I thought It was great. The characters seemed to match and play well with the schemas of the characters. The voices slipped once in a while but still, I thought the tone and overall VA's played their part well in fitting in with the atmosphere of the anime collectively. I thought there could of been more background audio though, that was a little disappointing. It was almost like the background was nonexistent at times, just unreal, fake and ""dead"". The background audio could of been a bit louder but thats me. Lastly, one thing I remember and will always remember is the OP and ED. Those tunes are symbolic and really caught the anime overall attitude. At the beginning, you're pumped and ready for adventure. The idea of a fast paced life of a space cowboy is etched within this seemingly vintage classic of a song. But at the end, the world is full of regret, the sun is set and is sailing on, leaving behind your past (or are you?). The Real Folk Blues.
Character (9.5)
Characters were a great bunch. The mismatch of this group all had their unique and memorable ambiance. Even the nonverbal Ein was amazing. Everyone had a past that was unique and stepped in at some point in the anime. The characters were relatable and I thought were well rounded for the development of the anime. I won't go into character detail because I would like the viewers to analyze and interpret the characters for themselves. 
Enjoyment (10)
First off, I do not believe that my enjoyment was led astray by childhood memories. The show was addictive, adventurous, funny and tragic at times. A perfect mix that made me want to binge watch the show. However, I knew that I would need to savor this gem to really absorb the material. And Boy I was glad. Watching this anime was really a treat that allowed me to forget my worries and troubles of daily life. It made me smile and it made me wonder. For me, I tend to create a deeper meaning that seems to enhance my appreciation of the Cowboy Bebop. Simply fantastic.",10,Loli_Mercury,

                Is Cowboy Bebop pretty good? Yes. Is Cowboy Bebop way too overhyped? Yes! Cowboy Bebop at the time it was made may have been fantastic, I have no idea, I wasn’t alive. But if you have access to all anime made up until this point, Cowboy Bebop is no where near as good as people will tell you.
Cowboy Bebop really shines in its characters, atmosphere/setting, and art/sound. Cowboy Bebop has little story, it’s mostly episodic. What story it has is good, there’s just not much. There’s little action, which is unfortunate because what action there was, was actually really good. I found that a lot
                  of episodes just had nothing happening and the dialogue and interactions could be entertaining sometimes, but often times it was just them complaining about being poor and having unentertaining/awkward conversations. 
Overall, the show had plenty of entertaining episodes with a fantastic world and great character building. But don’t be surprised if there’s times where you’re just waiting for the episodes to be over. It’s not a constant flow of entertainment and it’s not a great slice of life. Don’t be overhyped for this “classic masterpiece”.",8,SneezySaturn,

                THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW!!!!
Is there a single anime as beloved as Cowboy Bebop?! Do you know anyone who dislikes it or even attempts to criticize it??? Cowboy Bebop is considered to be one of anime's finest classics. But in all honesty, Cowboy Bebop is overrated. Sure, it's great but it's not a masterpiece fans make it out to be.
Cowboy Bebop is a mixture of several genres such as noir, western and sci-fi. Near the end of 21st century humans have colonized the entire Solar system. Our main characters, Spike, Faye and Jet are bounty hunters, which means they fight against crime in the
                  Solar system in exchange for money. That's the basic premise of this episodic show.
Most episodes of Cowboy Bebop are individual cases that aren't connected to each other. Most cases are interesting, tense and action-packed so you won't be bored while watching this anime. However, there are some episodes which develop the main plot of Cowboy Bebop, revolving around its main villain Viscious. There are exactly 5 of those episodes, and in all honesty, that's too few. The main plot alongside the main villain is VERY underdeveloped. Although often fun and interesting the overall plot of CB has its flaws because of so much wasted potential. Cowboy Bebop would have been better if it was more plot focused since the Vicious subplot is not irrelevant at all.
Cowboy Bebop mixes a lot of genres and the transitions between them is beautiful. I could have never suspected that space noir-western would work so well. The genre transitions make Cowboy Bebop unique and they are, alsongside the music, CB's strong suit.
The animation is very good for its age. Movements are fluid and the artwork is ahead of its time. OST and sound effects are perfect! I don't even like jazz but I was amazed by how great the jazzy OST of Cowboy Bebop was! The OST is also very diverse in order to fit several different moods. Voice acting is great both in the sub and the dub. Most people seem to prefer dub so I would reccomend watching the English version.
Characters of Cowboy Bebop are the aspect of the show which gets the most praise. But they are not that great. People usually like them because of their interactions with each other. Their interactions make them feel real and what's even better, you get to meet them by listening to their conversations. But if you're looking for real character depth than there are anime with much better characters. Sorry to say this, Bebop fans, but Spike is not really a good protagonist. On paper, he has a lot of potential as someone who is haunted by his past, but we don't get to know that until the last two episodes. Jet and Faye are much better characters with real depth and development. Vicious is just wasted potential as he could have had more depth if there were more episodes focusing on him. So, in conclusion, Bebop's characters are definetely well written, but there are anime with better characters such as: FMA(both versions), Fate/Zero, Legend of Galactic Heroes, Monster, Death Parade, Texhnolyze, Psycho-Pass, etc.
Cowboy Bebop is truly one of a kind. It beautifuly transitions between several genres and its character dynamics feels very real. It's not perfect, but it's definetely worth your time.
Final score: 7.5/10",7,ANT4,

                Even as a person who didn't love the series, I would still recommend it to other people for the atmosphere and specific characters. My favorite episodes were ones that didn't really make you try to follow an overarching plot, because it became way too hard to follow for myself. I think other people would probably enjoy the show more than I did if they can find characters that they really love to watch. For me, my favorites to watch were Faye and Ed, and the episodes that featured them heavily were the ones I not only enjoyed, but feel like I could go back and
                  watch again for no reason at all. As for the ending... I feel that it didn't do anything that Akira hadn't done years before. To really appreciate the ending, you have to absolutely love the main character, Spike Spiegel, which I didn't personally. It's a bit overrated but still definitely worth a watch.",7,operanerd,

                Out of 100 Nobles watching…
100 were impressed!
I have watched Cowboy Bebop many times, many many times. The entire series in one sitting? Maybe three times after this most recent viewing. Total episode viewings? Between Adult Swim reruns, viewing rooms at early 2000’s anime conventions, and trying to get everyone I’ve ever known to watch my DVD and Blue-ray box sets I’d say at least two hundred episodes. That is at a minimum EIGHTY HOURS of Bebop over the course of two decades which is probably seventy hours too many for most people to take my opinions of the show seriously. 
No amount of analysis or
                  deep-diving will likely convince a contrarian that my glasses are not rose tinted and I would of course be lying if I said I was completely objective in my analysis, I am obviously very nostalgic about Cowboy Bebop. I remember fondly being WAY too young and watching the show with my mother late at night and having real conversations about the content of the show, it being the first time I encountered narratives that rarely had cut and dry black and white conclusions. The series played an integral role in my development and has certainly flavored my tastes in all media I consume. Still, I will firmly state that Cowboy Bebop is a masterpiece.
It had been at least a few years since I had watched any episodes of Bebop, and what better time than months after the release of the live action show? A friend and I had recently finished a viewing of Eureka Seven and Evangelion last year it felt right to keep up the tradition of regularly washing the palate of each anime season with a “classic”. Approaching the show with a meaty, critical, and very grown up brain I was pretty taken aback that there really isn’t a bad episode of Bebop, and that if you don’t like the show it is for one of two very simple reasons. You do not like Jazz or you simply do not like the show. Both of these reasons are entirely understandable and I will never try to argue, dissuade, or invalidate your opinion. However, do not for a single second try to convince me the show is of low quality or “bad”. You may not like the narratives, the structure, or the pacing, but the plots of each episode do not lack substance, the story is not delivered without context or subtext, and each shot in each episode has a purpose.  My greatest concession would be inside the text of some of the commercial break timecards Cowboy Bebop invokes Harlem jazz musicians stating it is a “new genre itself” which regardless of what you think about the show is a statement so full of itself I’m surprised Hideo Kojima wasn’t involved with writing it.  
I have given a number of more recent projects perfect or near perfect scores. There were plenty of terrible anime made between 1970 and 2009 and the reason people talk about Cowboy Bebop and shows like it so much is because they are the standouts. I worry that many people will see someone praising Bebop or Evangelion and write them off as relics of the past who think way too highly of their favorite shows from when they were growing up, but it really isn’t my fault old classics are made with a vision.",10,Moomochi,

                     For me, Cowboy Bebop is a beautiful example of how expectations can radically affect your enjoyment of something. I knew hardly anything about Cowboy Bebop before watching other than the fact that it had a legendary soundtrack and was considered to be one of the most popular anime of all time. By the time I finished the show, I understood the reputation for both of these claims, but  I couldn't help but feel a bit empty after I finished. This wasn't the good kind of empty feeling that some people experience however, like how one may feel sad after
                  finishing a show they loved and desperately want more. I still wanted more from the show, but this more came from a place of dissatisfaction rather than enjoyment.
     Cowboy Bebop turned out to be something radically different than I thought it would. Looking at the episode count and legacy the show carried I thought this would be a very plot-heavy show that had zero filler, got straight to the point, and bowed out before it got the chance to get stale. This description hardly applies to Cowboy Bebop, with the only thing that still remains true is the fact that it bows out before it got stale. With my expectations missed, I started to grow a bit resentful towards the series, even though I still enjoyed it despite everything. I absolutely loved the dynamic that Spike and Vicious shared, and I loved virtually every episode that explored the backstories of the characters. Particularly episode 5, which remains one of my favorite episodes of any anime thus far. But the worst part about this enjoyment is that, like mentioned before, it just soured the rest of the series for me when it turned out these conflicts would only be explored in the minority of episodes. After a couple months though, the show never really left my head, and I did feel like I was still missing out on something despite finishing it, so I decided to give it a re-watch. Not only would I re-watch the show with another person, to introduce it to them and to get another perspective in real time, but I also wanted to re-watch it already knowing everything that happens, devoid of expectations that had the potential to be crushed; and this second viewing changed it all for me.
     After finishing the series for the second time, I learned a very crucial lesson; to not view a show based on what could've been, but to appreciate what's there. Knowing what happened let me watch each episode in a different light, seeing them as the mostly self-contained adventures they truly are, rather than the snippets of a larger story I wanted them to be. This further allowed me to appreciate the more artistic side of the show, with the absolutely gorgeous animation, character and world design, as well as the legendary soundtrack, of which a very large amount continues to be something I listen to on a regular basis. Focusing on what was there instead also allowed me to appreciate the characters even more.
    Without going into spoiler territory, each person in the main cast and their stories, past present and future, build on the themes of the show, or in the case of Ed and Ein, act as a thematic foil for the rest of the cast to look towards. Each character had an understandable and relatable backstory that justified the oftentimes cold and apathetic ways they acted in the present. Overall this show is just an absolute masterpiece, and is not only something I love and appreciate on an artistic level, but also on a more personal level as well. Spotting musical and theatrical references, reciting lines from the scenes I've re-watched multiple times, blasting songs from the soundtrack in the car, it's all stuff I hold very near and dear to my heart now. I can easily recommend this to anyone, including people who've never seen an anime before. And I can also say with confidence that this is one of the greatest shows I've ever watched, which I firmly believe is an opinion that will not change for a very, very long time.",10,DavidWilsea,

Why am I writing my first review for a more than twenty years old anime?
-Well...I don't know. I have seen many awesome animes, but after I've seen the last episode of Cowboy Bebop, I felt that I must write a review for this anime.
After this short prologue, I think I should start the actual review.
Story 10/9
First of all, I don't like episodic animes. They usually get repetitive and boring after a few episodes. However, I loved Cowboy Bebop's story! In my opinion, it has it's own flaws, still it's the best episodic story I have ever seen. Every episode is unigue, they don't get boring.
It has good comedic episodes, but when drama takes place, it becomes perfect. For me the more dramatic episodes were better.
And finally, I want to talk about the ending. I think the producers couldn't have made a better ending. It's outstanding.
Art 10/10
I don't want to talk much about the art.
The art is beautiful and stylish, even two decades after it's completion.
Sound 10/10
The voice actors made a very good job. And the music is awesome. This anime has one of the best OSTs I've ever heard.
Characters 10/10
The character design is amazing. Every character has a unique and interesting personality. There is no boring characters.
 And the best part in the anime is the backstorys of the characters. Every backstory is interesting. For me, the best moments were when the backstorys were revealed.
Enjoyment 10/10
I really enjoyed this anime, even though I don't like episodic animes.
Overall 10/10
This is a great anime. I recommend it to every anime watcher and to non-anime watchers too. 
It's a must watch anime.",10,Prohunter10,
1,"
                For me, this show sits in a weird category of shows that I appreciate but don't really enjoy. 
The art style is beautiful and the space noir aesthetic is cool. It has some very grown up themes about carrying the weight of your past and features very fleshed out characters. It has some great shots and the soundtrack compliments everything fantastically. 
Objectively I say it's an amazingly well done show in pretty much every regard, but somehow I just didn't connect with it the way so many others here seem to have. I didn't hate it, but purely on an enjoyment level, I thought it
                  was alright. Maybe it was the pacing, maybe I'm just not at a point in my life where the themes hit home, I don't know.",7,redwooddown,
1,"
                I have been putting off watching Cowboy Bebop but I finally watched it to see what all the fuss is about. I tried watching it 5 years ago but I dropped it 4 episodes in. I knew it was a good show but it just didn't vibe with me and I got caught up with other anime that interested me. However I decided to watch it after watching the horrible Netflix Live action. This has been bothering me for the last 4 days, giving me great headaches and I've actually had trouble sleeping, trying to piece everything together and figure what my problem is with
                  the show...this is more just for me to bury my thoughts once and for all and hopefully some people can resonate with it.
Cowboy Bebop is an episodic action anime, meaning most of the episodes are self contained and can be watched generally out of order, say you missed 1 episode and came back the next week, you won't be lost unless you roll unlucky die and miss some episodes that briefly connect with each other. I can imagine this anime would be great back in the day, the glorious days of VHS, DVD and especially TV. I'd love to watch this anime if it was on TV, but in this day in age and especially in Australia that ain't ever happening. The anime is about bounty hunters who are haunted by their past and they are trying to cope and live out of their past however they have to confront thier past eventually or find closure.
Usually I LOVE episodic anime, I slightly lean to enjoying more slice of life / comedy anime but I do have some action anime I enjoy. The nature of episodic anime allows for freedoom and more subtle exploration of characters, which is great! It can slowly build up to something and in the end have a huge payoff. That sadly isn't the case for Cowboy Bebop. The tone of serious episodes to hilarious episodes is kinda like emotional whiplash in a binge setting. It's a double edged sword that doesn't work off of each other I find!
The way it does characterization and character development is through very very small crumbs or there would be some episodes dedicated to a single character or episodes dedicated to the entire team! I'm not sure how to put it into words.. It feels disjointed or left me with wanting more. I needed closure and I hoped I would get closure. However maybe that was the theme and tone the entire anime was trying to go for, sometimes we don't get closure and problems come and go and we move on. That may be so but it doesn't help me feel like I'm enjoying the show. I feel blue balled. I believe, had Cowboy Bebop used its episodes a little smarter and would make mini arcs to give the proper time and breathing space for us to take in the emotion these characters are feeling. 2-4 episodes dedicated to these character episodes and between those arcs, definitely go with the episodic tone and have enjoyable moments but at the same time, allow for things to progress despite being essentially filler. Yeah that's another thing, it just didn't.. feel like anything progressed, for some reason my mind just couldn't process these growth or appreciate the somber tone. I can see it, feel it but I can't emotionally grow attatched because it seems like before I even can, the episode ends and another episode begins! It feels like the tone it was going for was to talk about adult life, how things are sadly complicated for each and every person but we don't talk about it, how every character has a problem and backstory and that they don't want to tel anyone. How we are basically drifting and how sad things in the past got that, that is what we have to deal with, the off chance of missing or seeing someone, creating a butterfly effect, a true tragedy. The best way for me to describe this theme IRL wise is once being close to someone in high school, all your high school friends but then as we grow older, we drift apart, had we kept up with a few or tried better or had we not cut someone sooner, things would had been different. Or learning a lot from a co-worker but sadly the job ends and you basically never see or talk to them again. How basically our time is limited for us to care about others. Cowboy Bebop does convey that emtion and theme very well.. but I.. I just don't know. I didn't enjoy the way it expressed it in the end, I needed closure! I needed some pay off! Some direction that it was building to something. It just suddenly ends.
I wish Spike was actually the main character and more of the episodes were anchored by him, so that we have a POV to work off of. So that everything is more personal and the way he learns, we learn. Have the syndicate plotline hinted at or the actions of the crew slowly build to a point where they HAVE to confront their pasts. The actions and consequences of the funny episodic episodes or semi serious ones could build towards the next major arc! But there's none of that! The episodes I enjoyed the most actually are the slice of life / comedy episodes like the entire crew getting high on mushrooms or Spike meets Andy who is just like him in everyway and it only annoys Spike.
I can't vibe with the story or direction of the anime. However the characters, art and music is of course first class, amazing quality. Has it's own character and its world hmmhh pretty decent. I wished there were more location shots, so we can see the entire area and get familiar with the planets so the characters revisiting them would feel like a treat! 
This show is basically the god father of these type of episodic action anime anyhow! It created this sub genre! Darker Than Black was basically created by the same people and objectively Darker Than Black is worse but I actually enjoyed it more, it had mini arcs which allowed for more time for us to be invested in the character of the arc even though they'll probably die but we also saw small crumbs of the Main Character and it often involved HIM being apart of the problem. Black Lagoon! I haven't finished it but so far, it feels more focused than Cowboy Bebop and the characters work off of each other much better. A Certain Scientific Railgun is basically a spawn of this genre as well, I reckon Railgun perfected it and found the perfect balance between episodic and plot, where the standalone episodes still build towards something.
Cowboy Bebop is definitely unique but it's not for me sadly, it has every point that I should enjoy it, every reason I should enjoy it, however in the end it was a let down for me. I feel like Cowboy Bebop is sadly overrated to be honest, maybe had I watched it on TV back then I would have loved it, but as of now, that is nothing but a pipe dream.",7,PikaCheeks,
1,"
                I can understand those who say all the praise CB gets is undeserved and that the anime is overrated. For the first six or ten episodes, I had  this feeling that people nowadays just uncritically praise what has established itself in the mainstream for decades, Cowboy Bebop being one those cases. The only thing that kept me watching the show for these first impressions was the Opening Theme, by far the best I've ever heard and probably the best there is out there. It feels timeless, special and different, easily standing out from all the pop punk screamo bands that feature in these day's
                  animes and are just downright annoying and generic.
But a instrumental jazzy song can't carry a whole anime on its amazing harmonic shoulders, of course. 
What made Cowboy Bebop special to me, first of all, is exactly what I least enjoy in other animes: episodic narratives. The repetitiveness of a formula that is abused in each episode - (slight) variation of a same theme -  is extremely boring to me. Gladly, that's not the case for CB. 
Seemingly apathetic bounty-hunters in space can sound uninteresting for those who dislikes westerns like me, but when it comes to Cowboy Bebop, it is not the same trope, it is not the same formula.
Spike, Jet and their crew face uniquely special adventures each episode, which perfectly incorporates and embraces the sci-fi theme into the narrative. The episodes themselves had this sort of short-movie like quality that wasn’t uncreative in the least. Some were pretty simple, like the ones portraying the life of the crew inside Bebop, but still, it added dynamic to a trope that seemed to be constrained by the dystopian side of sci-fi (not really in the context of the 90’s, I guess). 
The gist of the show, or should I say, the closing of Spike’s arc is only disclosed in the end of the show. It wasn’t anything mind-blowing or  beautifully crafted like a ancient greek tragedy, it felt just like The End. Some might say it was just irresponsible, but the magic of the entire anime didn’t fade in my eyes.
The art is just out-of-this-world beautiful. For me that means that I can see things as they are: no flare, no sparks, no needless reflective objects, just plain urban-like scenario and the flick of a cigarette, my favorite aesthetic. The characters sometimes look taller than usual, or just pretty asymmetrical sometimes, but, well, that doesn’t bother me at all.
Except for the delay in disclosing each character’s background, and sometimes doing a poor job at that, the overall work feels like a 10 for me. I’ve never experienced watching something like that, and I feel grateful.",10,liebesspiel,
1,"
                (I try to keep my reviews short and sweet and straight to the point without giving away spoilers with that said lets get this show on the road)
Cowboy Bebop , is an old school, well thought out /planned anime. Anime's like these are so hard to fine. Something that is easy to follow and understandable. Most anime's nowadays are so colorful, with great animation but the story line and characters are completely shot. 
Story- The story gives off an original feel. Every episode left be wanting more and it was so easy to follow. However, there were too many plots they tried to squeeze into
                  a 26 episode series. Some questions were never answered. I believed that they tried to cover up these lapses with one big plot overall.
Art- The art was so retro. I loved it!! It totally took you back to a time were details to each character (no matter the importance or stance) was important. 
Sound- The voice actors did a great job with bringing these character to life.
Character- Some characters were develop more than others, which was a complete let down. They opened the flood gates but never closed it. Nonetheless, no character was completely left alone as a filler. Some episodes were completely dedicated to one character. Thus, it gave the reviewer a deeper sense of each main character.
Overall- I enjoyed this anime. I loved the style and how the creators used there own creative spirits to make this anime come to life. Overall it's a wonderful anime and I would recommend it to anyone.",8,daisyfang4,

                Cowboy Bebop was, what you might call, my ""gateway anime"". Basically, it was the first anime I ever watched all of the way through. Sure, when I was younger I saw some episodes of Pokemon here and there, but I never actually started and completed an anime series in full. So, therefore, Cowboy Bebop was my first. And, while I may be a bit biased because of that, I think I can safely say that Cowboy Bebop is a masterpiece, or as close to a masterpiece as it can get.
STORY: 9/10
Without delving in spoilers, Cowboy Bebop follows a group of bounty hunters on the Bebop,
                  an old and worn down spaceship. Almost every episode follows a new adventure, almost completely unrelated to the previous. In one episode, they may be targeting a drug dealer in the deserts of the Tijuana asteroid colony. The next, they may be on Mars, targeting a dog thief. As you may gather from this, the series is very episodic, with only a few episodes revolving around the ""underlying story"". I quote ""underlying story"", because when you're watching Cowboy Bebop, you're not watching it for an epic science fiction noir story that spans multiple episodes. You're watching it for the here and now. And while, yes, the ""underlying story"" is interesting, and you want to see it play out, that's never the main focus. The focus is on the character interactions and the ""bounty of the week"" format. And, for what it is, it's great. 
If I were to have any complaints about the story, it would be that not every episode is as great as others. For example, the episode ""Boogie Woogie Feng Shui"" is not nearly as good as the episode before it, ""Pierrot le Fou"", or the episode after it, ""Cowboy Funk"". And while, yes, having every episode be amazing is a hard feat, when this show is great, it is really great. But, you can definitely tell that some episodes, just aren't as good as others. But, in spite of this, I still give a 9 to the story, because for me, hits like ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"" overshadow episodes like ""Heavy Metal Queen"".
ART: 9/10
Plenty of anime series from the 90s have a distinct look and feel to them. A lot of the time, this look and feel is dated, and doesn't hold up quite as well today. An example of this, would Trigun, a very similar anime to Cowboy Bebop. Cowboy Bebop, on the other hand, doesn't have this problem, and most of the art and animation holds up well, even 20 years later. Watching this, it's sometimes hard to believe it's from 1998, and it makes you wonder what they could've done had they had today's technology and equipment. The animation is incredibly fluid, a perfect example of this being the fight scene in ""Asteroid Blues"". The art is beautiful, a perfect example of this being the church scene in ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"". Again, if I were to have any complaints with the art, it would be that the digitally rendered scenes don't hold up quite as well as the hand drawn sequences. But, this scenes are few and far between, and aren't horrible to look at, so I still give the art a 9 out of 10. 
SOUND: 10/10
Perhaps the category Cowboy Bebop is most well known for, the sound is outstanding in most every way. The music is amazing, and fits quite nicely with every scene it's in. While Cowboy Bebop is known for having a jazz and blues soundtrack, it's surprising just how varied it really is. For example, ""Heavy Metal Queen"" has a very, well, heavy metal inspired soundtrack. ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"" has a very lyrical soundtrack, with songs such as ""Rain"" and ""Green Bird"". And, of course, it would be a disservice not to mention the amazing OP and ED sequences, with ""Tank!"" and ""The Real Folk Blues"" respectively. Both of these songs are now iconic, and immediately identifiable as Cowboy Bebop. Overall, the OST is one of the best in anime history.
Another aspect of the sound I wanted to touch on, is the dub. While the sub is very good, and I have zero complaints with it, it says something when even the original director of the anime says the English dub is better. This is the one anime where almost every one agrees that the dub is better. Even avid sub watchers, who almost always refuse to watch anything else, agree that the dub is better for Cowboy Bebop. Every actor gave it their all, and every voice fits the character. There's never a time when the dub doesn't match up with the lip movements. And, of course, the dub features the masterful work from Steve Blum, as Spike Spiegel. There's no wonder this guy is considered one of the best in the business. His work as Spike is consistently amazing, and possibly some of the best voice work in any animation, be it anime or not. Overall, the sound definitely deserves a 10/10 in my opinion. I have zero complaints, not even nitpicks. 
CHARACTERS: 10/10
This is another category where Cowboy Bebop really shines. The chemistry and the interactions between each of the main characters, is one of the draws of the show in my opinion. It's what each episode relies on, and why it's enjoyable to keep coming back to the show, even when each episode is very episodic. Each crew member of the Bebop has their own complex personality, and their own complex problems from their past. I don't have a whole lot else to say when it comes to the characters, without just talking about each character and delving into spoilers. It's just something that's best figured out while watching. Overall though, the characters are perfect, and I give this category a 10/10.
ENJOYMENT: 10/10
When it comes to my personal enjoyment of the show, I would have to give this category a 10. Like I said at the beginning, this was my first anime, and it was a great one to start out with. Almost everything about it caught my interest, and I ended up finishing it within a week. It opened my eyes to a whole other medium of entertainment, that was unlike anything I'd ever seen. Cowboy Bebop is still one of the best anime I've ever seen, and for that, I would have to give the anime the following rating:

                COWBOY BEBOP: Is this a masterpiece? It depends on how you define the word.
Cowboy Bebop has received significant attention worldwide that it comes to the point that it has been considered an anime masterpiece. But is this claim justifiable? In my opinion, the term masterpiece is somewhat vague. If it is synonymous to perfect, then I must say that Cowboy Bebop is not a masterpiece at all. It has its own flaws -- like any other story. If it signifies something that is a work of a genius, then Cowboy Bebop’s position becomes debatable.
The story revolves around Spike, Jet, Faye, Edward, and Ein -- the
                  crew of the Bebop. The series appears to be somewhat episodic, for it doesn’t really follow a solid overall story. It merely talks about the adventures of the crew. One could argue that Spike’s storyline is actually the overall story. But this is apparently not the case, for it is not substantiated enough to be considered as such. At best, it could be called a story arc that is scattered all throughout the series to add mystery to the franchise.
However, the storytelling is not purely episodic in terms of technicality. It still follows a logical order in the story sequences. What I like about this kind of storytelling is that it gives the viewers different perspectives of the Cowboy Bebop universe. The fact that it doesn’t just follow a single story makes the fictional world more open to exploration. What makes this episodic approach more effective is its ability to give sufficient amount of screen time to each character, so there is a lot of room for character development to take place.
The crew of the Bebop, I must admit, is very balanced in terms of personality. The characterization of its members is distinct enough for each of the characters to leave an impression -- not to mention that these characters blend well together. Spike is the laidback dude; Jet is the mature and reliable one; Faye is the chic that has a lot of attitude; and Edward is the jolly character who counters the solemn mood. Aside from Edward, each of them has a problematic past, which makes them much more relatable as characters. What makes them even more believable as characters is the fact that they show traits that are beyond their character framework -- like how Faye actually shows a lot of emotion despite her portrayal of being a heartless trickster. It just means that they are not surface-level characters with unique traits just to appear solid; they actually have depth. Even though Edward has no tragic past to make her more concrete, she is not a problematic character. Her role of balancing out the crew is enough to consider her all right.
I don’t normally tackle music in my anime reviews. I only include it if it is worth noting -- and yes, Cowboy Bebop’s music is worth the notice. Its concentration on jazz and blues gives the series a very distinct atmosphere. And I know that it is impressive when one of the best opening themes of all time is of an anime that has been released in the 90’s!
So, after everything I have said, is Cowboy Bebop a masterpiece? In its technical aspects, it is debatable that the series is a work of a genius. But it is still not perfect! It is only a matter of defining what masterpiece truly is. I define masterpiece as something that has made a significant impact in its art form or beyond. So, as a personal note, Cowboy Bebop is a masterpiece, just because it has become widely influential not just in the anime scene, but in science fiction in general. That’s enough for me to consider it as such, for, I believe, that defining masterpiece as a perfect work is just absurd.",9,pageprophet,

                --ANIMATION-- 
The best of 90's technique was used here, the characters and specially the futuristic elements had a great job in model design, its one of the best animation in a weakly released-type series. 
--STORY-- 
Because it was made in a time before internet, when people kept switching channels until find some to watch, it follows a model of independant story for each episode that sometimes reveal fragments of a main storyt, it is not realy a great model nowdays but they made it very well, kept me joyful watching to the end. 
--DIRECTION-- 
Influenced by ocidental noir movies, but it don't stays in the
                  shadow of that, i think it's the best part of the show, the cinematographic language is not just a detail, it contributel to the understanding of the chara",9,Bebop_Spike,

                The title is an experiment to cram a variety of genres into the Bebop Space-punk setting. In spite of this, like good music in a dance, its beat is as addictive as it is coherent, and the individual melodies of each key character's development - each plot point and progress - leads viewers in a waltz into the inevitable end. 
The music's great, and the animation (especially action sequences) hold up despite being from so long ago. The story's also pretty timeless. 
It's not complicated. Just listen to the self-referential OP - it's time to blow this scene, get everyone and the stuff together, and

                It’s probably pointless to review this series at this point. Cowboy Bebop already has so much acclaim from the Anime community that another positive review would just be so much white noise. The reason I even bother to write this is because, for once, I actually found a series that lived up to its immense hype.
I don’t want this review to be nothing but comparisons to Samurai Champloo, but seriously, this has “Shinichiro Watanabe” written all over it. The two series feel very similar: a cast of flawed but likable characters, traveling from place to place, getting into trouble and as time goes by we
                  come learn about their mysterious pasts. Jet is the quintessential big brother we all wish we had, Edward is hilarious, (I didn’t really care for Faye, she doesn’t seem to contribute much) and as for Spike? Oh Lord, Spike Spiegel is a BAD-ASS!!! He kicks all kinds of ass, he has a bad-ass spacecraft, and he’s a strong three-dimensional character who does everything with such gravitas. These are the people you wish were your friends in real life.
Another strong point of the series we can attribute to Watanabe is the atmosphere. The mish-mash of different genres, Western to Sci-fi and everything in between, gives this series an art style that has never been seen before. No other anime has dared to combine cigarettes and spaceships, and I don’t believe any other director could bring this concept to life. But who could supply the sounds necessary to accompany this visual feast? As always, Yoko Kanno delivers. I don’t think the music score is as memorable as Champloo’s, (the exception being “Green Bird” from episode five) but it was the perfect fit and helped to set the tone of the series. Side note: “Tank!” IS the greatest opening theme for an anime ever written.
As for the voice-acting, I watched the English Dub, and now I understand why this Dub gets so much attention. Not a single character is miscast. Not one. Every random Joe on the street, all the numerous side characters that come and go throughout the series, they all serve their exact purpose: sound realistic while not distracting from what else may be going on. Of course, the real stars of the show are the main characters. These are some of the most believable performances I think I've ever heard. Steve Blum’s role as Spike Spiegel truly speaks for itself. (No pun intended)
As much as I want to give this series a perfect score, there was one thing that didn’t sit well with me. Whenever I finish watching an anime, I ask myself “so what exactly can I take away from this series?” Honestly, I can’t really find an answer for that question. Perhaps, it will come to me at a later date, but for now I see this series as kind of pointless. By the end of Cowboy Bebop’s run, it doesn’t feel like much has been accomplished. Don’t get me wrong, I loved watching these characters interact; but as a narrative Bebop feels lacking.
They say it’s not about the destination; it’s about the journey itself, and this jazzy space odyssey was one hell of a journey. Cowboy Bebop was loved in its time, it’s loved now, and it will continue to be loved far into the future. You owe it to yourself to watch this series.

There are so many good things about this anime.
Cowboy Bebop combines everything that you would find good in anime to create a masterpiece. Arguably making this series a staple in the anime industry. The perfectly constructed story, art style, and world that has its own aesthetics, use of jazz and blues in the soundtrack, and the memorable characters make this a series worthy of being one of the best.
The story takes place in a futuristic sci-fi universe where our main characters are bounty hunters. Each episode introduces a new story that the characters have undertaken. As the series goes on we are introduced to
                  more characters who join this bounty hunter crew. Each character of the main cast links to the story's main theme of overcoming past trauma. They all struggle to move forward and escape their trauma. An idea that makes the cast feel more like real people.
The art and animation are brilliant, despite being over two decades old the animation is still comparable to modern-day animation. The animation also blends in with the environment effectively, the way the environment and characters are drawn and portrayed, creates a unique aesthetic that you can't find anywhere else. However, the use of CGI was poor, to say the least. While I will sympathize considering the time period, The occasional 3D animation stuck out like a sore thumb.
The use of jazz and blues is something you don't find often within the soundtrack of anime. Considering these genres are more common among the western culture. Seeing this genre of music in an anime would instantly contrast itself from the soundtracks of other anime, that also fit into the world of Cowboy Bepop.
The characters are easily the highlight of the show, each member of the main cast linking to the main theme of the show. Overcoming and living with horrid pasts. The most obvious example is the protagonist Spike, each character overcomes their suffering. Ed returns to family while Faye recovers her memories. But Spike only comes to terms with his past during the finale, where he finally feels alive.
The themes of past trauma intertwined with this narrative. The brilliant art style, the unique genre of soundtrack use, and the memorable characters make this one of the greatest series of all time.
Overall, I rank this 9/10.",9,OfficialBandit,

                Oh Cowboy Bebop, how I adore you! If you have watched anime for any period of time you have at least heard about this series. It is an anime famous for its amazing and relaxed soundtrack, lovable characters and mature but fun story. Let us get started reviewing this work of art!
Story - 7/10
Wait a minute, haven't I just been praising the series for being a work of art? How dare I give the story a 7/10. The thing about Cowboy Bebop story is that is extremely simplistic. Now is this necessarily a bad thing? Hell no! The relaxed story blends in perfectly with the
                  setting of Cowboy Bebop. It doesn't attempt to tell a story which explores some deeper meaning, because that isn't the goal of the series. The story helps you to learn to love the characters and the world in which they live. 
Art - 9/10
For the time in which this series was created, it packs some glorious animation. I love how much western influence is put into the world of Cowboy Bebop. Vivid, earthly, colors fit the western theme of the series, to mind-blowing planets, infrastructure and science fiction which is done on a realistic scale. The character design is nothing to be ashamed of either, sporting some of the literally coolest looking characters ever created.
Sound - 10/10
Once again here comes the western influence of the anime. Great choice in music at the correct timing makes this series even more pleasant of a watch. The OP of the series fits perfectly with the relaxed and smooth tone of the series, while the ED ties in with the more serious moments within the anime. Whether you are a fan of more dated genres of music, like Jazz, Blues and Classical or not, this musical score will most definitely leave some sort of an impression on you. The voice acting is especially great in the Dub version of the series, with Steven Blum's portrayal of Spike Spiegel being one of the best examples of English dubbing within an anime.
Character - 10/10
One of the defining principals of any great entertainment medium is without a doubt the characters within the series/movie/anime/novel ect. This is yet another thing the anime does perfectly. Featuring some of the coolest characters to date as well as some of the quirkiest characters ever. From the cool and suave Spike, the reserved and wise Jet, the sexy and brilliant Faye or the adorable and innocent Ed, Cowboy Bebop is bound to have you hooked on one of the fantastic main characters. What Cowboy Bebop does better than almost most anime ever, is the way they portray their characters as human beings. They aren't some fictional characters which children aspire to be but someone you can relate towards.
Enjoyment - 10/10
Being a cynical piece of shit like myself, I really couldn't believe how much I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop and I ended up enjoying it  more than any other anime I have ever seen. The reason being is that the show takes all the elements I love from anime, sprinkle some heavy western influence on top, to create one of the best recipes for anime out there.
Overall - 10/10
If there ever was an anime out there to be dubbed as a Masterpiece, Cowboy Bebop would be my first candidate. Sporting incredible visuals, a soothing soundtrack and one of the best casts within an anime, Cowboy Bebop is an anime deserving of a 10/10 rating and I would recommend the series to anyone, because it has something to appease everyone.

                Cowboy Bebop: highly rated in the anime community, abnormally well received outside of the anime community, accompanied by a cult fan-base... sounds too good to be true...
But I must say, that I don't believe the show has helped with any cures to diseases, scientific achievements, breakthroughs in technology, or advances in diplomatic relationships.
So I guess it does have flaws.
But if you haven't watched this show and are an anime fan, or even if you are just browsing this website, then you have spent some time devoted to anime that could've been better spent watching this show.
I find it a shame that anime is clouded by
                  people who complain about the episodic nature of the show. Compared to Bebop, a series that relies on overly-dramatic cliff-hangers is shallow. Bebop is developed: from the complexity of the characters (if you only see the main cast as their surface presents, I suggest to rewatch and pay more attention to the details of the characters pasts, as well as their present) to the vivid animation (and I don't mean flashy colors, I mean how the pieces move, their shape, design, etc...)
Lastly, the quality of the music can not be understated. Almost every single anime on the earth suffers from its cliched garbage music. Thank you Bebop, for bringing us a soundtrack that I don't want to skip over, but I can even call a masterpiece.",10,Sakkeru,

                Cowboy Bebop is my first Anime ever.
I watched all the episodes in one sit, 10 hours non stop.
Although I'm not into Anime in general, I was very interested in watching Cowboy Bebop because some people recommended it to me and I've heard that it's one of the best.
Now that I watched Cowboy Bebop, I really want to talk about it and share my thoughts on it.
First of all, I loved the main characters! I thought they were pretty much perfect; awesome personalities and development, beautifully written dialogue and a good sense of humor.
The story is absolutely fantastic! I really liked the premise and it's philosophical
                  themes.
Also, music is amazing and the art style is very fitting and charming, and the quality was surprisingly high for a TV Show of the 90's.
The only thing I didn't like about Cowboy Bebop is the episodic format; some episodes felt a bit off the pace.
My absolute favorite episodes are Honky Tonk Women, Ballad of Fallen Angels, Ganymede Elegy, Jupiter Jazz 1 & 2, Cowboy Funk, Hard Luck Woman and The Real Folk Blues 1 & 2; they were outstanding!
Pros:
+ Exceptional narrative
+ Superb characters
+ Really great music
+ Very charming visuals
Cons:
- Episodic structure
Final Rating: 10/10
- Masterpiece -
Cowboy Bebop is a phenomenal piece of art that will stick with me for a long time. From the lovable characters to the wonderful narrative and the funky music, Cowboy Bebop is special.
Do I recommend it?:
Yes! It's a must-watch in my opinion.",10,YannisSp101,

                Cowboy Bebop is now officially my favourite anime, and its not nostalgia or a biased perspective.  going into this into this completely blind  I have never indulged in an experience quite like cowboy bebop. but what is a cowboy bebop and how has it gained its title as truly genre defining classic? cowboy bebop is focused on the planetary adventures of the bebop crew consisting of Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine, Radical Edward and Ein (A welsh corgi) the crew go on misadventures from episode to episode In their ship The Bebop, but through out the episodes each characters past is revealed
                  through memorable moments and character dramas that can only be fully appreciated if you see them first hand.
But how does the average episode of cowboy bebop play out? well cowboy bebop really has no underling plot to most of its episodes except for some (which I will not spoil) and are mainly short and self contained episodes that further each characters relation ships this is what gives this anime in particular a unique feel as it really does feel like you are going through the solar system with them hopping between planets with no real ultimate goal other than to make it through the day and we can all relate to that... not the solar system part but the desire of nothing more than to make it through and that's how cowboy bebop makes its unrealistic events feel real along side the developed and interesting characters.
However its not perfect, its was mentioned that cowboy bebop uses a mostly self contained and sometimes comedic structure for its episodes and that's one of the reasons some people don't like this anime. to be brief if you think that the idea of self contained stories from episode to episode tied to gather by narratives and character moments that happen very sparingly through out the show then by all means watch it but that lack of a constantly developing story and no real ultimate and established goals for any of the characters is a big turn off for many. other than that there is a part around the middle of the season that is pretty boring and unsubstantial but that is about it.
Now onto the details and general synopsis for the main crew.
Spike: A experienced member of the red dragon crime syndicate and has a troubled past he would like to forget about
Jet: as one of the only remaining honest cops in the corrupt law system Jet left his work to pursue bounty hunting.
Faye: A wanted bounty who through a turn of events made it onto the bebop crew.
Ed: a talented hacker with a child like attitude
Now would I recommend this show? absolutely. Despite the few complaints and the animation that is frankly showing its age, cowboy bebop deserves all the praise it gets and is an absolute classic",10,SolidOne,

                Having slept on this for over two decades to both my chagrin and that of my peers, to say that this was a bit of a disappointment would be one of the crowning understatements of the very same stretch of time. I hear Bebop described as the ""least anime"" of the medium as a whole which makes sense, what with it ostensibly being just a string of one-offs benchmarked by expository character moments and the occasional bit of filler, all of which vary drastically in terms of overall quality.
All in all, it's not necessarily unfocused as the primary aim's to highlight a wayward band of
                  outcasts' unlikely bond and collaborative approach to the bounties they flub time and again, however the latter episodes bring about an abrupt bit of closure for all. A bit jarring on account of how Jet's arc wraps itself up (much) sooner than everyone else's and abrupt in this case is more synonymous with rushed as the two-part finale doesn't allow for emotions to bubble and burst. It's cathartic all the same but nowhere near as poignant, especially when the series hints at said poignancy with each semblance of closure it tosses our way. It's an aesthetically sumptuous and richly drawn world for sure, and it definitely scores points for being a freewheeling exercise in coolness, even if the decades-spanning hype train made this all the more underwhelming in the end.",6,sund0wner,

                Cowboy Bebop a Space western. 
This is a show I saw for 4 months because I didn't wan't it to end so soon (And partly because I am quite lazy irl). I have my moments with it.
I have had many times I have had nothing really to do and that was the time I watched Cowboy Bebop - a show which emphasises on nothing. All the characters are pretty much chilling in the lounge and only get up to go after a bounty when they are out of food. The show defines the true meaning of chill.
There are moments when there's tragedy and people die.
                  The episodic style of anime truly shines here.
The next best thing about CB is its characters. Especially Spike.
Sprezzatura is the word that describes Spike. However, it is also a character I relate with. Laid back style, genuinely caring (but not showing it).

                Cowboy bebop was one of the most unique anime I have watched and dont get me wrong, I try to watch as many different ones as possible. It still doesnt feel anime, it probably never will given the way the medium has evolved. The music is haunting, the comedy is situational, the story is episodic and the characters, well they are the weirdest misfits of all time.
It is one show which isnt about the moral of the story because there isnt any. Even though in some way its about dealing with your past cause thats a weight you're gonna carry, its all about anticlimatic endings.
                  There is no winner, no one is riding into the sunset and thats what sets it apart.  Every episode tries to touch some other genre and its unapologetic about it.
Cowboy bebop is one which I will never forget about because of its storytelling. It doesnt try to be funny or happy. Its a story about 3 people dealing with the weight and 1 kid trying to see past all of this gloom. 
As far as characters go, all 4 are unique and memorable. Jet is the dad, Faye is the rebellious sister, Spike is the lazy stylish older brother and Eduard is the overenthusiastic youngest kid. Eduard is the quirkest one and you'll fall in love with her soon. Spike is criminally stylish and has the charm which can make anyone go week in their knees. Jet is the guy who you can rely for your life. Faye is the one who you hate and love at the same time. And how can we forget our super smart dog Ein, who is the black horse at times. Their banter is when the show is at its peak.
Cowboy bebop is wildely inconsitent and only few episodes shine. Episode 5 is Bebop at its best with its criminal use of music and action. What I love about the show that even though its full of style, its not flashy and very subtle. A true masterpiece",9,darthgera,

                Cowboy Bebop is a classic. It's known and renowned as an anime which you must watch. I really loved it. Something about those four characters and watching their adventures was wonderful and I can safely say that this is one of my favorite anime, I truly think that you should watch it. The story follows four people living as bounty hunters and although most of the episodes are unrelated stories, they all tie in at the end for one last adventure and end with a bang. The soundtrack is beautiful and the opening song always cheers me up. It is truly wonderful.

                Cowboy Bebop is one of the best shows I have watched, period. The first episode sets the tone, with a seemingly upbeat and almost flippant protagonist, who reveals himself to be cunning, battle-worn, and melancholic. This start sets up a string of subtly interconnected stories that begin to unravel the past as we come to understand what type of show we are actually watching. The true marvel of this show is what we are not shown. Cowboy Bebop takes place after the climax, after the heroics, after the action; it gives us characters that have taken the punches, lost parts of themselves along the way,
                  and are seeking to cling on to a sense of meaning in their post-story lives. It is fitting that the main characters are basically drifting through nothing, as this is true to who they have become. 
This brings us to the introduction of Faye Valentine and Ed; the two characters representing hope and the future. Faye brings mischief to the group, a sense of change to shake up their lives and wake Spike and Jet out of their melancholic stupor. Her developing feelings for Jet give hope that he may awaken to what he has before him, and bring him from his prison of the past. Ed serves as a beacon of joy, laughter, and new life for these middle aged veterans, and brings some of the best story moments of the series. 
The music of Cowboy Bebop is legendary, and acts as a focal point of the series, bringing life to each scene and truly resonating long after the show has gone. And there are many powerful moments the show presents, touching on moral issues, healing wounds of the past, and giving closure to chapters of life. The ending itself was beautiful, tragic, and captivating; and I think it captures the soul of the series vividly. I highly recommend this to anyone willing to give it a chance",10,containment13,

                Well, Cowboy Bebop is almost twenty years old and still as a masterpiece, with one of the most memorables soundtracks evermade. It's not a mistake saying that the ost is, somehow, a character, an intermitent part of the story, the conductor of the orchestra that this anime is.
The episodes are well-done designed for the developing of the main characters, creating with the spectator a short-medium relationship of affection with each one of them. Look: there are only 4 main characters (5, if you count that fabulous dog), and you will be sure, until the end, that each one matter so much and has a great
                  background behind them. Seems something that sould be obviously in any entertainment work? Well, it's not, and here we can see it done in an amazing and unique way.
Cowboy Bebop is, in a general way, an episodical anime, and it's normal that some episodes will give you more pleasure than others, but it doesn't become a defect exactly. There are so many vritues about the anime that any possible defect seems very small and maybe you don't even notice.

                Cowboy Bebop is quite possibly the most overrated anime of all time in my opinion, But that doesn't mean it was a total waste of a watch. The anime is a collection about 20 one shot stories with little snippets of character lore thrown in that seem useless for the most part. The main villain seemed to have no prevalent motive and was in about 4 episodes or something. Here are my thought on it 
Story: 5
The story was a major disappointment, like I said its kind of irrelevant. Its just a bunch of one shot episodes and if your lucky maybe you'll have 2
                  parts. The episodes aren't bad , just this anime would have been SO good if it held a prevalent storyline and went into the trauma of some of the characters (FAYE) more. 
Animation/art: 9
The art and the character design is beautiful, and the animation is pretty damn good excluding some bad cg planets. The costume for Spike is the embodiment of swag and really gives him that nonchalant badass vibe. Also not to mention the fights were very well animated especially the first episode.
Music: 10 
What can I say, The music fucking slaps bro . I mean bebop IS in the name.  Yoko Kanno really did a good job boring that space cowboy and jazzy vibe to the story.
Acting: 9 
Lots of people who watched this while it was airing in America love the dub, I think it has one of the better dubs out there but I do prefer the sub. The voice actor (kaji from eva so sexy) for spike really is just perfect for his badass vibe and the others characters delivered very well for there characters too .
enjoyment:7
It was an easy watch and kept you enticed for the most part. Not like "" I need to see the next episode now"" though.
overall :8
Most people seem to be blinded by nostalgia on this one . While it does deliver amazingly in most categories, I'm still disappointed in the story. This could have been one of the all time greats if the story was prevalent. I still would recommend it to most , just don't go in thinking its amazing",8,Yuki_Mak,

                There isn't any other anime like Cowboy Bebop! The well written characters, relatable plots and inner struggles from each character is one of the many reasons I re-watch this anime year after year. The music is absolutely beautiful, unique and gives this show such a cool, jazzy aesthetic. The colors and space scenery in this anime really put you in the world of Cowboy Bebop and creates a sense of mystery, adventure, and all around fun. Although all the characters are gems in their own right the standouts are Spike, Ed, and Ein!This 90s anime is a must watch and a good starting point if
                  you're beginning your anime journey or interested in the works of Shinichiro Watanabe.

                One of the all-time anime greats, Cowboy Bebop was a series that went well beyond what to offer up for a 1990s TV anime series in terms of both presentation and storytelling quality. Focused on the exploits of the members of a group of bounty hunters aboard the Bebop spaceship, the series mixes around episodic and ongoing storylines to tell its different tales involving Spike, Jet, Faye, Ein and Ed as they hunt down criminal targets and come to confront tragic elements of their pasts.
The storytelling approach to Bebop was unique for its time (and still holds up to this day) as many titles in
                  the 1990s either offered an ongoing plot line or focused on episodic developments with its cast. Here in Bebop though, the storytelling focus is more fragmented as episodes are either devoted to exploring the Bebop crew going after a bounty that are mostly self-contained or dealing with issues related to their past that offer more ongoing development as the series progresses, particularly with Spike and Faye's stories. Each episode helps to explore more to the world of the series or flesh out another major element to one of the Bebop crew's developments. They also have varying moods and themes explored throughout the show's run, offering a mix of film noir, westerns, sci-fi, horror, comedy, action, mind screw and drama throughout the show's run. The show is heavily influenced through Western pop culture, and it shows with its homages and parodies to popular Western media franchises and figures like Batman, Gunsmoke, Alien and Bruce Lee.
Bebop depicts a realistic approach to its sci-fi world, preferring to apply a mix of scientific advances like astral gates and spaceships with settings that closely resemble those found within the modern era unlike the futuristic settings that titles like Akira or Outlaw Star would portray. Planets and moons colonized by humanity look more like modern era cities, each having their own varying issues with criminals, poverty and corruption. In addition, ships like the Bebop and Spike's Swordfish ship are regarded as relics of a past era by those having more modern spaceships via the standards of their time period.
Visually, Cowboy Bebop is easily among one of the 1990s most impressive looking titles. It offers vast settings that have a good deal of detail and take place in a variety of settings that include space, cities, mountains and sewers. Many characters are drawn with lifelike and realistic details, not sporting the typical “big eyed” anime look you would expect of many titles with characters sporting a variety of looks and some being attractive without going overboard with the looks, like Faye and Spike. Animation is consistently fluid throughout the series and applied in a variety of ways throughout Bebop's run that include physical fights, gun fights, spaceship fights, realistic physics applied to floating in space and evading incoming obstacles like gunfire or wreckage. CG animation is employed for some of the show's more elaborate animated sequences like computer screens and space wreckage, but these bits are rendered so well that they fit seamlessly in with the show's regular animation.
The soundtrack to Bebop is just as excellent, taking on the same Western influences that the show's storytelling elements employ as it milks use of Western genres like jazz, blues, country and hard rock to flow along with its presentation. Composed by famous anime composer Yoko Kanno, Bebop is easily among one of anime's best soundtracks that you can listen to, whether watching the series or enjoying just the music itself.
With its high-quality presentation and storytelling that are heavily Western influenced, Cowboy Bebop is easily among the very best offerings that the medium of anime has to offer with its excellent storytelling, visuals, soundtrack and characterization for a TV anime that is easily accessible to both newcomer and veteran alike.",10,ggultra2764,

Genre: science fiction, space western, comedy, action, thriller 
Anime takes place in 2071 where it is almost the entire solar system is inhabited by humans. Our main characters who travel with a spaceship Bebop are bounty hunters. They make money by hunting criminals.
Protagonists: Spike Spiegel, Faye Valentine, Jet Black, Edward (girl btw), and a dog named Ein. 
They could only earn money if they bring criminals back alive. Anime has a little story arc about the main character Spike and his great love Julia. Arc also talks about Spike's life inside of syndicate and about his

Besides the main characters, minor characters also are written very well. The final episode was very emotional and it is one of the best anime endings ever.

                Cowboy Bebop is considered one of the “greats” by many an anime fan, and despite my resistance to giving a show a 10/10, I’m inclined to agree. Cowboy Bebop displays an understanding of the stories its taking inspiration from, while also adding to and transforming those stories into something new and entirely unique from the things it takes inspiration from.
To begin, Cowboy Bebop respects its audience in a way that most shows simply don’t. Cowboy Bebop rarely ever tells the audience what’s happening in a scene, or how a character feels, unless it is absolutely necessary. It allows the audience to inference and theorize and
                  come to their own conclusion about a character’s intentions and emotions, something which few shows, even decades after Bebop’s release, manage to accomplish.
Cowboy Bebop is one of the most visually and musically pleasing pieces I’ve seen in media. Its character designs perfectly showing off what kind of people they are, further emphasizing the moments these characters break their stereotypes and become human in a way most shows simply don’t allow for. Its music is legendary among anime fans. With the opening theme “Tank!” being my personal favorite of any anime.
Cowboy Bebop also tells its story in a way semi-unique to television. Its character backstories are never outright explained to the viewer, instead small inklings are given to the viewer and they are left to put these pieces together, making the show seem mystical and leads to a frankly epic conclusion which I cannot spoil here.
Cowboy Bebop is the most pure science fiction experience I’ve had in a long time. It doesn’t bog itself down in explaining away the terminology of the world the characters inhabit, instead just allow the viewer to fill in the pieces they need. Rather than large portions of episodes dedicated to explaining technology, Bebop ignores that in favor of focusing on its characters.
All this and more makes Bebop one of few shows I would glowingly recommend.",10,Jarq_Dude,

                11. Continuing from my Detective Conan, Death Note and One Piece reviews, I am still documenting my anime journey.
Cowboy Bebop is truly the best gateway anime for newcomers.
Back then, we got introduced to anime on a special TV channel and were mostly watching ""kid-friendly"" anime like Naruto, Beyblade, Yugioh, etc.
We later found out that another channel was airing anime but only after 23:00 PM. It was MTV and they aired shows like Ghost in The Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Cowboy Bebop.
Both of these shows superb masterpieces!
It is a must watch for every anime enthusiast.
In my reviews I don't talk much spoilers or go too
                  deep into the story. 
In the end if you wanted that you could just read the description of the show or watch a no-spoiler trailer or something.
If even after 23 years, people still remember this show fondly and it holds up like good wine, then it is clear that the show is good.
To be honest I only sometimes managed to watch it on TV and even then the episodes did not make much sense because I skipped the ones before.
I watched it whole when I seriously sat down and looked Cowboy Bebop and GIS on the internet.
I was always intrigued with the episodes on TV. Later a lot of people were talking good things about it and literally no one was saying anything bad (back before MAL and similar websites).
Back then people's opinions mattered because they had developed tastes.
Today every donkey has the opportunity to vomit their opinion as a review and similar sycophants of the show will support each other and breed toxicity.
That's why I do not trust the opinion and reviews of people, especially here on MAL.
I'd like to re-watch it soon, it is a great show, I don't even have to tell you this.",9,Yugesai,

                It's been tough getting into anime made in the 1990s, but this series, definitely one of my favorite anime in that period. Everything about it fascinated me and hooked me on until the very end.
The plot itself was simple, cowboys combined with sci-fi, but throughout the series, it expands on various genres contained in each episode. Not only does it showcase how the main cast doesn't get along with each other, but it further shows how impactful each of their cases is during the plot of each episode. The variety of tones Cowboy Bebop goes mixes in well, from a dark and frightening episode to
                  a sad and emotional episode, combined well it makes a good plot.
The story started a little slow, but manage to build up to deep character arcs for all of the main cast. It starts with a space cowboy and his comrade hunting down criminals for their bounties, but once they pick up new crew members, it starts to expand more on their backstories while chasing after those criminals at the same time. At times has its comedic moments, but also contains serious events that impact who they are and eventually lead to a nice and exciting ride to go on.
The Bebop crew was really fun and diverse compared to other anime groups. It was the case of opposites attract, yet can work with each other despite not getting along making the interactions between them unique in their way. A major theme among them is their character arcs. For example, the main girl Faye Valentine was shown to be a woman with attitude, however certain episodes expanded more on backstory and gave her the goal to figure out for herself. The best part about them is that their character arcs are well-written and wrapped up by the time Cowboy Bebop was about to end and it felt satisfying for them to realize their answers to their past.
The soundtrack in this series is by far my favorite part as it went on. The opening was so good and I like how it was able to sound amazing while having no vocals at the same time, making it iconic during each episode as a result. The background music felt like a 90s series, and it felt satisfying to hear while adding that with some impressive animation showing how it's a sci-fi series as well. On a separate note, the titles of each episode were my favorite titles of all time.
Overall, this classic shined bright like the stars in the night sky, it has well-written character arcs and showed how diverse each of the characters and episodes is. While the ending is still one of the greatest mysteries in anime, the plot and story will drag you in for a funny, yet amazing ride as we get to know the characters more. Spike Spiegel will always be one of the coolest characters in all of the anime and gave the best character arcs out of the Bebop crew. I recommend this series for those that want to get into anime and start becoming a fan of them in the process.",10,mythical_k,

                Rating this show was hard. For me it's between an 8 and a 7. The characters were likeable, the art and sound were fine. The show was enjoyable. But the writing was so fatally flawed that it brought the story down. Put simply; there is no overall message of the show because every episode is a self-contained story that has little connection to the overall plot.
Cowboy Bebop is an anime that starts strong. It's likeable. It makes an impression on the viewer with its two main characters, Spike and Jet, and how they have such a strong bond.
But, the anime suffers from poor writing and
                  story. It very commonly falls into cliches and tropes. And it's a short-story simulator. The effective formulation of a macro-story, a story that contains all the figures of the main plot and effectively develops all their character development simultaneously, is non-existent. 
There's a reason why Evangelion gives the existential threat of Angels or a ""third impact"", LOTR has the ""dark lord"" and so on and so forth. The purpose of these existential threats that target everyone is that they target EVERYONE. That they make everyone learn the value of one and another so that they act cohesively and thus act like a team. There is no such existential threat in Cowboy Bebop. 
The only threat in Cowboy Bebop is how much debt the characters are in.
There's also the issue of character progression. Spike is the same hothead in episode 1 as he is in episode 26.  Jet changes to not be afraid anymore and Faye does significantly change because she learns she needs people/a home. But the protagonist himself doesn't learn anything. Which is a shame because he is such a great character. One of my favourite protagonists of ALL time. 
Oh, and the other 2 characters who are apart of his crew? They are useless and do nothing. Also, not to mention the antagonist is awful. An antagonist for the sake of being an antagonist.
Furthermore, Cowboy Bebop has a serious case of Deux ex Machina. In the last episode for example, one of the characters is doing a vehicle getaway and is being pursued by assassins when they are magically saved by one of the main characters who is in this specific place for no other reason than they had to be for the sake of the plot. This is not a one-off coincidence. The entire series is filled with this type of writing convenience that trivialises any actual serious writing. If I was being fair, I'd give the story a 5 for such BS.
It's annoying and I let the anime get away with it because the characters are likeable.
Overall, this anime is good. I'd say watch it, but you can't be too critical and just have to let yourself enjoy the characters. Because the writing is bad and will make you roll your eyes with how bad it can be.",7,Mackson2002,

First and foremost, I absolutely loved the music. 10/10
I think my enjoyment waned whenever the plot would shift from a stand-alone episodic format to exploring the pasts of the main cast. Personally, I enjoy stand-alone episodic animes and I would have preferred if the entire anime followed this format. 
That's not to say I didn't enjoy exploring the main cast's pasts. I especially enjoyed figuring out Faye's past and her struggle with her identity, and Ein's conclusion did leave me emotional. Whilst Ein's story didn't go into much depth, the depth and time Faye's story got really made me invested.
On the other hand, I
                  did not understand Spike's backstory as much. This may be due to me being an idiot, but I also felt that a lot of the storytelling for Spike were these single-frame flashbacks rather than a fleshed-out story like Faye's. This led to a lot of confusion for me and thus I ended up not caring for Spike's story, which is a shame considering that I would have enjoyed exploring how a criminal syndicate in a futuristic space time would have evolved and the politics surrounding it.
I'm sorry Jet but I really did not care for your story :'(( Anytime the story would explore Jet's past the anime just grinded to a halt for me and I struggled to get through the episode without skipping. But this is a personal bias than a storytelling one. Ironically, out of all the ways the backstories were told, Jet's was probably the best where it was a balance of all three I described before (just detailed enough with single-frame flashbacks to balance it).
My main gripe with the anime is just how they jumped between exploring backstory and then stand-alone adventures.",7,keepingupwanime,

                It didn't quite hit me until the show ended just how much I took the interactions and journey between Spike, Faye, Jet , and Ed. The journey was a fun one and there was always something going on and the characters were the ones who always shined. The story was good and tended to go in a non episodic format which really worked. Even more impressive were the characters. They were all lovable and had something they were chasing.

All of the stylistic elements are amazing. I loved the music, the anime and the different variety you get with the story arcs. 
One aspect of this show that I liked was the resolution. There is a part at the end where one of the characters leaves the group. That is
                  kinda sad, but it is life. Some people stay and some go. Also there is a definitely conclusion to this anime. I think that is so healthy and true. Lots of times we get second seasons, but we shouldn't. Tell the story, take the viewers to some fun places and end the series.

                Quick take: As the series ages, the artwork begins to feel dated. The series is also episodic and at times can feel tedious to watch, this all pays off in the end as we're treated to several arcs that never converge, but rather run parallel to each other. It's a fun concept and explores the theme ""all things must come to an end"" in a unique way.
The story follows the members of the ""Cowboy Bebop,"" a cargo ship. In many ways, the story is more about the ships' adventures than the crew currently piloting it. We are treated to four minor character stories and one
                  major story that all explore the concept of ""all things must come to an end."" What makes this show unique is that the individual stories never really converge, but run in parallel to each other. Every character is exploring their past and coming to terms with it, eventually moving forward.  They all follow the same arc, but in a way that is appropriate to their individual stories. The entire show is about being stuck in life and having to come to terms with some event in the past in order to move forward.
The art work is good for the time period but as time goes on, I'm not so sure it holds the same muster that it used to. That being said, it was a minor point and wouldn't prevent me from watching the show again.
Character development is on point and many of the characters have become easily recognizable inside and outside anime culture.
Music is great, especially if you like bebop.
Overall, if you've waited way to long to see this show or you've just come across it, it's a phenomenal show that although a bit tedious to get through is well worth it in the end. I would suggest once finishing the show, doing a little research on the themes present within as it will help you to appreciate the story all that much more and understand that it may not have been quite as episodic as it seems.",9,stmwg01,

Cowboy Bebop has influenced the Western perception of anime and is one of the most popular, being the entrance to anime made aimed at an older audience for many. Shinichiro Watanabe creatively payed homage to Western pop culture and film tropes, blending various genres, and forming carefully-crafted storylines and fascinating characters. 
Each episode tells a different story with a new bounty to chase; the main storyline slowly develops (as do the characters), still following on from and referencing previous episodes. 
The
                  main group of ragtag bounty hunters are cherished for their pseudo-family dynamic. Spike is a dashing, carefree slacker, haunted by his past. He is often portrayed as cool and laid-back, but there are moments of deep loneliness and melancholy, breaking his apathetic facade. He moves in an effortless, fluid-like motion, which is fascinating to watch during fights. Jet is a former cop, and longtime friend and business partner of Spike's, who is loyal to and is always looking out for the other characters. He reminds me of a dad - he is always fair, reasonable and cares for the others. Faye is a gorgeous but arrogant, self-absorbed, dishonest, sarcastic femme fatale, who has an unstoppable attitude and can often be seen doing nothing whilst the others are working hard. Despite this, she is independent, shooting a gun better than any man. Ed is an energetic, androgynous, strange young girl, as well as an extremely skilled hacker. Ein is a genetically engineered Welsh Corgi. I loved seeing each character's past explored and watching them gradually develop as the series went on. 
Cowboy Bebop is praised for its soundtrack, which uses a variety of genres, most notably jazz, to create a perfect atmosphere. It has my favourite ost out of any film/series I've ever seen, which I still listen to often; some of my favourite songs from it are Gateway, Rush, Bad Dog No Biscuits and Cats on Mars. (Fun fact: I bough a harmonica because of this series.)
The animation is stunning, especially amazing for a 90s anime. Although dull at times, the colours and shading were beautiful. The backgrounds were very detailed and the fight sequences were incredibly entertaining. I especially loved the opening; it's my favourite out of every anime I've ever seen. 
Cowboy Bebop, one of my favourite animes of all time, gave us a masterful mix of different genres, unique characters and enthralling fight sequences. I definitely need to rewatch this one day. 🪐",9,Halloween1978,

                Cowboy Bebop is the perfect introduction to anime for those who are unfamiliar with where to start. The reason being is that is a perfect representation of multiple genres of what anime has to offer a new viewer. A few examples: Cowboy Bebop more often than not relies on both overtly and subtle humorous moments to carry over serious subplots, the seemingly unforgettable lessons and musings that are unique to each character we are introduced to in the show, while we're speaking of characters- each character is memorable and has a well-defined story you can follow- even in the one-off arcs, and the action that
                  is included in the story line is gripping and fits evenly into the overall plot of the series. It never feels forced or out of place. It moves with the story fluidly.
The animation style of the series is also timeless in my opinion. A lot of people have their preferences of studios and animation style, but Cowboy Bebop doesn't rely on that to carry the show, the art compliments the various tonalities of the series well and has held over time.

a little about the history of the series
It follows the adventures of four bounty hunters on board the space ship Bebop. It takes place in space where everyone lives because Earth is basically uninhabitable. Don't let this put you off though. I am not a huge fan of space things and I really did enjoy Cowboy Bebop. The characters on board the Bebop are all memorable and I liked all of them. I didn't feel that any of them were pointless which is something that I find in a lot of series.",9,kirakosian12,

                Cowboy bebop is an excellent anime. Despite being made 20 years ago, its art, animation and sound outpace many modern anime. It does not cave in to anime tropes and because of that, it manages to stand out in the space. However, cowboy bebop is not a masterpiece and it struggles from several fatal flaws.
First of all, it has an episodic structure. This distances it from the traditional arc-focused anime storytelling, giving it uniqueness. However, this format suffers from the fact that individual episodes wont feel as meaningful, since you know in the end there wont be substantial changes to the status quo. 
Also, some
                  of the episodes lag behind in terms of quality. Episodes 7, 10 and 17 in particular didn't do it for me.",8,Scandalous21,

                Cowboy Bebop is probably the best representative of top-notch anime in the 90s. Though it is old, its animation is high quality. The storyboarding is outstanding, too, as if every animated frame is like those of Holywood movies. In addition, sound effects and music are pleasing to the ears. The only thing that may have ruined my viewing experience is that most of the episodes follow the traditional television format - that each 20 minute is a standalone story instead of arcs. As someone who used to binge-watch anime, I find it challenging to finish.
Nevertheless, I understand why many anime critics consider this a classic.
                  Set in a dystopian future where the entire solar system becomes a Wild Wild West, Cowboy Bebop is more than an action-packed gun and mecha anime. As each episode unravels different sides of the characters, the whole story is all about four lost souls who end up finding a place to belong in a space-junk wandering in outer space.
However, like the revenue of bounty hunters, the journey they momentarily share is not steady but fleeting. Too bad that our friends can be the family we choose, but when the circumstances will not allow, we have to give up the bonds we formed in pursuit of finding another home -- a place to return to where people are thinking of us. Cowboys Bebop's clever ending reminds us of the attachments we chose to sever, the memories of people we carry in our hearts, and the goodbyes that make us feel empty inside.",9,Humabon,

The episodic aspect was executed perfectly, and i never found myself disinterested in any of the plot lines - even the more ""boring"" episodes, like the one where the food infests the ship, are hilarious and fun. I loved the ending of the show, and the mysteries of Spike's flashbacks were incredibly engaging. furthermore, I found the dub in this
                  case particularly fitting, since the show is based on the western cowboy narrative. And Faye is just one of my favorite characters period.

                Cowboy Bebop is one of the most moreish shows out there. It's effortless entertainment. It ticks all the boxes. Amazing script writing, great setting, awesome characters, fantastic plot and a stellar soundtrack. It has super short, impactful episodes which are done in impeccable noir style. You know when everything's said and done at exactly the right moment to the point that it's art? That's what this is to the 10th degree and there's a good use of synchronicity which only adds to its addictive factor- everything's just done so darn well and seamlessly blends together. It has the emotional factor, humour, action, adventure, mystery etc.
                  The setting is massive as its interplanetary and yet many times it feels so small like when Faye bumps into Julia or when they accidentally stumbled upon Ed's father. The show has the benefits of both an extremely vast setting coupled with a small time feel of bumping into people they coincidentally know. I wasn't keen on Faye's extreme sexual objectification- that was the only crummy part for me. I'm also not a fan of space shows- they do nothing for me but I somehow still really liked it. It also helps that space wasn't the setting for a lot of episodes and scenes.

Some shows can be excused from any form of presentation as that’s the status that “Cowboy Bebop” has in the anime industry as one of the all-time greats. It is an original project animated by studio Sunrise and what a job they did.
As expected from a top-tier show all-around, the animation is very good. From the original and breath-taking backgrounds and different places where the action takes place to the awesome fight scenes with fluid sequences and pace to them, makes “Cowboy Bebop” a very appealing show for the eye. This is also not even referring the amazingly designed and
                  iconic set of characters and machines such as ‘Swordfish II’, the famous red ship belonging to the protagonist, that inspired multiple types of protagonists and support role characters throughout the years.
However, where “Cowboy Bebop” truly shines is when you join this unique cast and unreal and intricate alien-ish landscapes and places with the masterclass writing of the characters and stories. Since this show functions, most of the time, in short stories, that help to complement a major overarching plot that climaxes at the end, these need to be all equally good so that it prevents viewers to lose interest on some and focus only on others. Lucky, “Cowboy Bebop” offers a variety of very interesting and exciting adventures all tied up with amazing dialogues and awesome jazz music.
As one of the most recognizable and innovative shows at the time, “Cowboy Bebop” is in a league of its own in the genre and, with so many qualities, is no wonder it is one of the most loved and better rated series out there.",9,ICenturyI,

Iv'e watched so many movies, tv shows, and admittedly only around 13 anime, but iv'e experienced plenty of stories.....and at some point i knew.....this is the best thing i'll ever see. I often hear people say that if you rank Bebop highly then you're being pretentious/overly intellectual etc, but honestly i just think the people who are ""meh"" on this show are simply indifferent to it,
                  rather there being any criticism (at all) that actually holds much weight. Simply improve your life and your attitude and i think pretty much everyone will enjoy this show eventually, even if they don't initially.",10,LIND-L-TAILOR,

                Tried writing a short review on one of my favorite anime out there, hope y'all enjoy reading it :3.
Cowboy Bebop is an episodic anime which is highly character driven, it has some of the best main casts out there, where all of our main characters who are unique and driven by their own pasts make the Bebop crew together, which brings for highly enjoyable character dynamics, and makes the characters feel like actual people. The show consists of overarching themes like loneliness and the relationship with one's past and in a lot of cases trying to know oneself more through it. Even the interactions with
                  some temporary side characters in the show have weight to them and, in a way fleshes out both the side characters and main characters without the interactions feeling too forced. The soundtrack in this show is just magnificent and only second to Steins;gate's soundtracks, with beautiful animation even for a 90s show. All in all Cowboy Bebop is this beautifully crafted piece of media which is definitely a top 3 show in my personal books.",10,RayZ666,

                It's a show that was fantastic, maybe even a perfect storm, for its time.
It had good art and animation. It had a blend of episodic content and a central plot. It had a fairly consistent presentation that took itself seriously, with minimal shifts to off-model or differently-styled art. Amazing, distinct soundtrack. An iconic English dub that was one of the first that could make people seriously consider that dubbing quality could match the original Japanese.
But I think in many ways, modern anime has caught up to or even surpassed Bebop. Many shows get good dubs. Many shows have good OSTs. Many shows have very expressive
                  artwork that sticks to a particular mood. There are shows with better episodic content and there are ""background plots"" that are told better or more-interwoven throughout the length of the series.
It's not that Bebop aged poorly, but it was just somewhat ahead of its time. If it released today, people would likely complain that most of the episodic storylines were bad, goofy, or forgettable. Let's face it, whenever anyone praises Bebop, it's for the main story episodes, mushroom samba, the fridge episode, and maybe Faye's backstory episode, and that's it. That's less than half of the 24 episodes. People would balk that Faye's sexpot character design is pointless fanservice. Same goes for the bounty hunter TV show where one of the cohosts is a girl not wearing a shirt. People should hate Ed, because Ed is annoying.",8,Marioko,

Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed and Ein have their solo stories and with the help of that we learn who they really are and who they were in their past and with that we bond with 5 of them.
But to be honest, I must say that ıt's story isn't great and sometimes I felt that it didn't have an any story and majority of episodes are just fillers, but

I began watching this anime with an unbelievably high expectations after getting recommended by so many people and seeing an 8.7 rating on MAL. Well for me the show is amazing but not really perfect as others describe.
What stands out for me most is how every episode brought a new story and finished it in the span of 20 minutes. There were no cliffhangers, no prolonged plot, and each of them were enjoyable.
The retro sci-fi art style and animation is also something to feast for the eye. Character movements are so smooth even when they interact with
                  objects, gunfights and space ship battles are exciting to watch, everything felt so alive. Even compared to an average anime at the present, Cowboy Bebop's animation is still top notch.

[SPOILERS AHEAD]
However I did not like how it ends. The crew was already over the moment Spike left for battle, and Ed and Ein walked away before the final arc. Jet being alone again with only his ship is super depressing for me.

Airing on Adult Swim with a fantastic dub gave western fans a chance to witness a classic on broadcast television. In 2001. The significance of that can easily be taken for granted to contemporary fans of seasonal anime today. I wish I could have seen it. 
Some of the most memorable quotes,
                  pastiches', lines, meme formats, and callbacks in modern anime can be found in this series. That novelty alone is worth your time. 
Cowboy Bebop has been written about ad nauseum but it has stood the test of time. Give it a shot will ya?

                This is a fantastic series. It has many flaws, some of which are quite significant, but the overall composure of the entire show make up for them. 
This anime, IMO, quite possibly has the best sound track to any anime ever, hell, one of the best soundtracks to any show ever. It's excellently composed and thought out to match the show in its various parts. The genres of music included is impressively extensive and majority of the songs are easily good enough to be produced without association to the show. 
Anyway- What really shines about this anime? The characters and their stories. Their past. Their
                  lives. We see a variety of lessons taught through the show; we see what type of actions cause consequence. We see raw ambition, we see arrogance, we see revenge, and more. But what's important is how it's all dealt with. That's where this show shines.
The most prevalent lesson the series teaches is not to let your past dictate your future. You can learn from your past, but don't let it dominate you and consume you never to escape until it might be too late. They do an excellent job of teaching the lessons to be learnt in the show, so I'll leave my summery at that. 
The main characters of this show are extremely unique and intriguing. From the start, you see so many different aspects and possible avenues of history for each of them. They each have their mysteries, but the questions don't overwhelm you so as that it could drown out other enjoyable aspects, but everything is answered when the time is right.
Alright alright alright, you just want an action show though, I get it. Yeah it's pretty good at that, and if that's all you're looking for than the show's flaws won't be as meaningful to you. The combat in this show is excellent, and when paired with the excellent music, makes for thrilling action sequences. 
Alright imma get into the issues now. First off, it's way too episodic. I'm aware this is a popular complaint, but I genuinely believe this show would be better as a whole if they trimmed it down and focused more on the story aspect. Don't get me wrong, I generally don't have an issue with episodic shows, but in this instance I feel like the main story could have used a greater focus. 
This issue isn't exactly aided by the first episode, which kind of throws off the idea and plot of the show, especially to a casual watcher. The beginning gives the impression that the rest of the show is likely to focus on the same plot as the first episode, but in reality the show is largely made up of different plots in each episode. This area may be more subjective though, that's just what I felt the first time I watched it. 
It also needs a little more hand to hand combat as a whole. What's in the show is definitely some of the most well done human-human animated combat I've seen, but I wish there was more. There's only like three, four proper fight scenes throughout the series and I was left craving more by the end. 
The show has a lot of other issues as well, but most of them are present in most anime as a whole so I won't bother picking them out as they don't really detract from the show much. 
Conclusion: watch the show. Unless you're the type who exclusively likes slice of life rom-coms and the such, you'd probably enjoy it. It has valuable lessons to learn.

                This is the first review I have ever written, so please bear with it. 
[TLDR] Cowboy Bebop is a masterpiece that gets better every time you watch it; however, it is not without its flaws. 
Context: 
  You can skip this context if you want, as I am trying to keep it separate from the review as much as possible. That said I think context is extremely important when it comes to reviews of older anime shows.
  I first watched Cowboy Bebop on adult swim as a kid. It was by no means the first anime series I watched, but it was one
                  of the first shows that really made me want to actively look for more anime. It opened my mind to shows like Beck which was also airing on TV at the time. I feel the context that Cowboy Bebop was a profoundly effective gateway anime is, and should always be, recognized. The industry would not be the same without it, but I do not believe this context should have a say on the rating of a show. A show isn't good just because a lot of people like it. This is the same for every other show too. A lot of people try and convince people to watch Cowboy Bebop while talking about it with rose colored glasses filled with nostalgia. For me, however, it was not always my favorite show. It earned that title by having by far the most re-watch value of any show I have watched - ever. I wasn't going to write a review, but I feel like the lack of ability to critique it properly is harming the the community's view of the show.  
  I don't care if everyone likes the shows, games, or media I enjoy. I do not expect everyone to like everything I do, but I want people to understand why the show is an enduring masterpiece even if they don't like it. I have very specific tastes, but I am capable of understanding that some shows are great shows even if, for instance, I did not enjoy them due to finding the main characters extremely disagreeable.  
Cons: 
  Please stop trying to convince people to watch the show because of the dub quality. The dub was great when it came out, but it is only of passable quality now. The writing for the dialog of the show does not stand up to the test of time as well as people would like to imagine it does. There are often moments in the show where the dialog can feel ""canned"". This is, in-part, due to mediocre writing, but also due to the lower standard of dubs of the time. Too often are characters speaking what should be internal monologs or should not be said at all as it is effectively shown without dialog. There are also issues with pacing and emotiveness. Sometimes there are stark contrasts in the voice acting quality of the side characters compared to the main cast, leaving what would have been perfectly good writing also feeling canned. The show is also far more dialog heavy than people seem to remember, perpetuating this further. I believe all of this ends up being a major problem when people new to the show view it for the first time, as their expectations are not met. 
 The older art style, not quality, can also be viewed as a con. It doesn’t hold up to modern aesthetical preferences but that does not mean it is bad. I did not detract any points for this as I do not believe the quality is bad.
Characters & Story [10]:
  In my experience, a lot of people struggle with the episodic nature of Cowboy Bebop, and this is understandable as it has become less and less common in modern anime. There is an overarching plot to the show, but the driving force behind the show is the character development. There is a catch to this, however, as much of the character development for the main cast (particularly the male members) has already taken place before the events of the show. On top of conventional character development, you get to know the characters and what made them who they are in a way that is akin to getting to know people in real life. The viewer pieces together information about their pasts with new insight from each new adventure.  Cowboy Bebop has some of the most endearing and enduring characters of any anime out there, largely because of how you get to know the characters in this way. Just as in real life, some of them are a little annoying at first but grow on you as you get to know who they really are. 
Soundtrack [10]:
  For those that are openminded musically the soundtrack to the show is one of the best out there. Enough people have talked about it so I won’t dive deeply into it, but I would like to say that it is also used extremely effectively. Sometimes it feels like you are watching a passionate fan's AMV just because of how much weight the music has on the moment. 
Art [10]:
  While there are elements of the art that don't hold up well to modern aesthetical preferences, overall, the art is very well done. It really shines when it comes to the animated action scenes which remain some of the best to this day. 
Re-watch Value [10]:
  I have re-watched the show at least 6 times in the last decade, and every time I do I find something more to appreciate. I have pretty good memory, so I often struggle to re-watch shows because I already know what is going to happen, and much of the details, and I find myself uninterested in so much of what is going on because I already know so much about it. I never had this issue with Cowboy Bebop, and its ability to keep me entertained time and time again is what makes it my favorite. 
Conclusion: 
  It is one of the best anime of all time, but it isn't something that everyone will enjoy. Don't overhype yourself when getting into it, and don't overhype your friends when trying to get them to watch it, as it will only serve to detract from their opinions of the show.",10,Darksparky,

                -- REAL FOLKS BLUE --
I`m a little too late with this review (decades late in fact). I had started the show nearly two months ago and was really taking my time with it. There was so much too discover and take in. I didn`t plan on writing a review, but suddenly felt the urge to do so after completing it. The anime has just so much greatness and history to it that I can`t let it go by and I wanted to write this review for my own sake. Because WOW! This anime is just otherworldly mesmerizing. If that makes sense. 
Before starting the anime,
                  I wasn`t sure what to expect. And as I started watching it, the anime kept evolving. And what`s amazing is it never lost it`s flavor every episode was just as equally good if not better. I will completely avoid spoilers, not just for the story but for the anime. Cowboy Bebop is best watched with zero insights. So here, I`ll just be talking about what I found most unique about the anime and why i fell in love with it.  
Among it`s many incredible things these are a few which stood out for me:
-The style of the anime. It`s mix of 90`s music and art-style gives the world so much personality. But the most unique thing is it`s music and how it is incorporated in the show. Written by Yoko Kanno, the music is among the best in the entire anime industry. It`s is a unique take on Jazz, with beautiful tracks. This anime won`t work this well without it`s OST. The director masterfully choose the right song, at the right time, for the right duration. 
There is so many people who I know who said that they fell in love with sci-fic, jazz, and animes because of cowboy bebop. The style of the anime stands out the most and leaps on to you. 
-The other thing which I immediately noticed was it`s unique way of storytelling. While other similar shows (especially sci-fic) would focus on the world, governmental figures, the law, morality, Cowboy Bebop focuses primarily on the character and only gives you the gist of the situation. It would want you to think about the characters motivations, past and fates. Something I deeply respect as it makes you more invested in the show. While this design has it`s problems, it`s something which greatly works in cowboy Bebop`s favor. It is able to lean heavily on it`s music and incredible writing to deliver incredible meaningful story arcs and closure. The entire anime is character focused, with everything building up the character and their ultimate story closure. 
-The last thing is the writing. Cowboy bebop reminded me who it felt to be surprised and joyed at the same time. The animes contains incredible and unique characters. And that includes everyone, not just the main character. Every episode will introduce a new character who will have a unique aspect to it. The anime will build up the entire episode and then drop a emotional or jaw-dropping reveal at the end. And none of it fells out of place. None of the episodes felt filler. Each was masterfully done and the level of writing never dropped. 
And all of these three things come together to create a work of art. An experience you`ll never forget and one which you will carry with you.
COWBOY BEBOP is one of a kind anime. It is something which fells genuine and unique, and I know I been saying that word a lot, but it truly is that. It feels like lightening in a bottle. There is no piece of entertainment media which aims to do what it does. It`s something which I would give my first 11/10. It`s that good to me. 
Cowboy Bebop is one of the best animes ever made, and THE most unique anime ever made (and yes I`ll die on that hill).

                While I agree that Cowboy Bebop is far from flawless and perhaps doesn't deserve the mythical status it has obtained, I can't fathom why anyone would ever knock the music!?
I see so many reviews that didn't even mention that each episode is named after a song, and that music itself is so much a part of the overarching mythos of the show.
Yoko Kanno is arguably the best composer in the world right now.  She can write any genre (she can change genres like most people change a t-shirt) and composed/orchestrated ALL the music for the show.  
The theme song, ""Tank!"" is the only
                  jazz standard to ever come out of Japan, and has been performed by the most prestigious of US military bands for the President at the White House.  If there is other anime music that has recieved such a prestigious performance I would sure like to know.",8,Audiomanic,

                I feel like I can sum up this review in five words: ""It's fucking Cowboy Bebop, dude.""
But that's lazier than Cowboy Bebop, frankly, deserves.
An absolute watershed, iconic piece of animation - of, frankly, television with no genre or medium boundaries - Cowboy Bebop is one of the most beloved, respected, and cherished pieces of anime television, and I'd say especially in the US.  And that kind of makes sense.  When put against its piers, Cowboy Bebop is one of the least ""anime"" of anime.  It's a story that could be told in a lot of different mediums - in, really, a lot
                  of different genres, as you could pare away a ton of the sci-fi, planet-hopping trappings and be left with an almost identical piece of storytelling that would lose very little.  This makes it commonly peoples' first anime, at least away from something like Pokemon or even Dragonball Z or Sailor Moon that feels, at times, like ""just a cartoon"" to a childhood audience, whereas Cowboy Bebop is clearly something removed into a new genre, and a new world.  No wonder it's so often recommend as a good intro-anime for people who aren't into the medium, since you don't have to put up with the wacky fanservice and distended faces and bizarre anime trope-isms that litter the medium, and look, a lot of that stuff is great, but it can be pretty goddamn impenetrable and off-putting to an outsider.
That being said, Cowboy Bebop doesn't run away from its medium, or its sci-fi genre.  It can exist safely and strongly without them, but that's a comment on its strength of narrative, character, and restraint, not a condemnation of the other elements.  Cowboy Bebop uses its medium deftly, better than most, to build a stunning moody, gripping, cohesive universe.  Later works like Firefly owe themselves to Bebop's sense of realistic sci-fi, and it's something that stands up with the original Star Wars as a lived-in, decaying, authentic world where space travel simply exists, and it doesn't feel glossy and unrealistic, but simply a part of life.  The starships and such of CB exist in the same plane as the heavily graffiti'd subway trains of our modern world, comparable to our time where air travel is commonplace and mundane, even frustrating, in a way that would be mind-blowing to those from a century before.
There are few worlds that really feel as cohesive as Bebop's, to both itself - a world that lives and breathes and exists and never feels like the fiction is pulling at its own seams, or barely painting over the rough edges that no one stopped to think about - but also to its story.  While you could drop the crew of the Bebop into 1930s New York or 1960s Shanghai or modern LA and not have to change a ton about it to make it work, this is a world perfectly suited to its cynical, jaded, wandering bounty hunters.
And what a cast they are.  Spike, Faye, Jet, and Ed are simply four of the most iconic faces in anime - a stunning 90s anti-hero who works as what an anti-hero should be, not just a gritty and violence asshole, but a man who is deeply flawed, mysterious, cynical, but driven by a good heart and an ugly past that is compelling without being exploitative; a femme fatale lead who is one of the most beloved women in anime, not just for her stunning looks but the depth of her charm, her broken bird charisma, the heart breaking reality of what being Faye Valentine is against the sensuous image she portrays; the grizzled right-hand man, who stands as the perfect balance for Spike, a fully defined and fully realized character in his own right that could easily shoulder the weight of his own narrative, and gets to on a number of episodic occasions; and even Ed, who seems at first like she's going to be your standard wacky comedy teenager, but has so much more to offer and say, with one of the most touching character send-offs I've seen in a long time.
And, look, there's this modern opinion that Cowboy Bebop has been deemed some unassailable classic that you're not allowed to say anything bad about, and maybe that's true, a bit.  It does have its fervent defenders.  And it should.  It's an unassailable classic like the Godfather is, frankly, or Citizen Kane - a movie I personally don't like, but can at least see the potent strengths in.  Hell, I don't like Final Fantasy 7 or Seinfeld, either, and I still know they're both genre defining classics.  That's what Cowboy Bebop is.
Is it perfect?  No.  The episodes can sometimes feel meandering, an episodic piece that is more interested in mood and philosophy than a defined arc or story.  If you're looking for a complete, coherent, satisfying narrative, Cowboy Bebop is not going to scratch that itch, more than likely, because it isn't interested in trying.  Bebop wants to tell you a story about who people are, about what redemption and atonement mean, about how your past defines you, or doesn't, about what it means to step away from the ghosts that haunt you, or revisit those haunted places and understand what's become of them.  You have to be willing to put in the work and peel back the layers to fully appreciate a show like this, and I don't say that to imply that people who don't like it are watching it ""Wrong"" or ""don't get it"" or, even worse, aren't smart enough to.  Sometimes you just don't click with things.  Sometimes you don't want media that forces you to do your homework and rewatch it again and again to get the full picture and appreciation.  Sometimes a show, or a book, or a game, or whatever should just be what it is, and can be perfect as what it is, without needing to be studied and dissected.
But Cowboy Bebop isn't one of those.  It's an ambitious, weighty, mature narrative, one that has stood the test of tine, with animation and visual and music and really every production metric you could hope for standing the test of time like it rolled out this week.  Bebop did one of the best things that any piece of media could do: it knew exactly what it wanted to be, on every level, embraced that style fully, and did everything it could to make it work.
Cowboy Bebop isn't perfect.  Nothing is.  To paraphrase a famous anime villain, perfection is the enemy of any scientist, or artist for that matter.
But goddamn, it gets pretty close.",10,jokerdesilva,

                Cowboy Bebop is an outstanding anime that still holds up to this day. The story is quiet different to what I am usually used to, where it does not follow a strict story line to reach a final destination, but an anime that consists of small different plots that involves bounty hunting, and in turn has some correlation to the overall storyline. Even with all of the depressing features to the show, the characters are able to get by with a smile on their faces even during troublesome situations. In the grand scheme of things, the story involves the impossibility to let go of the
                  past and the pointless efforts to find out if you are truly alive or just stuck in a dream. Is anything really real? Even with the illustrated view of a future, dystopian society, it really got me staring up at my ceiling late at night contemplating life just because of an anime. Made me feel like I was staring at a mirror for 26 episodes. But, then again... whatever happens, happens.",10,markinios,

                Critical: A masterclass in animation, music, character personality, English dubbing, and style. 
This is an overall consistent, timeless show with a few stragglers here and there, but plenty of fun (and serious) scenarios.
Personal: Although the series is structured episodically, each scenario is so distinct from each other, offering a package of genres, atmospheres, and movie-like progressions. And yet, everything feels coherent: the main cast is witty, charming, and real (in part by the amazing English dub); the animation still stands as one of the best I've seen, especially with dynamic actions scenes from fists, guns, to spaceships; the jazz music hits hard and often feels
                  involved with the scenario at hand.
While there is no central story at hand--a bombastic science fiction plot that could mean the end of the universe--the series carefully drops bits and pieces of these characters' pasts and motivations, developing these characters at a slow, low-key manner. If you're more inclined for stories that are more straightforward with character growth and overarching narratives, then this series may offer a change of pace. That is not to say the main cast is dry or bland; rather, we are observing them from a perspective where the most significant points of their lives have already past. Learning about that past is one of the most enjoyable aspects of this series.
Are there a few scenarios that miss the mark? Yes. Do I wish that the main cast could be explored further? Yes. But as it is, even after 20 years, Cowboy Bebop's vast variety of scenarios and animation makes it an easy recommendation for newcomers and anyone else looking for something a little unconventional.",10,SCA_CriticalEye,

                At first, I was recommended this show from a friend of mine. He said it was very good and that I'd love it. I was skeptical at first. Sure, I've heard of this show, but is it all it's hyped up to be? Does it deserve the praise it gets? To find out, I simply watched the series. Now, that I'm done, I can finally give my answer.
Firstly, I'd be remiss to not mention how much I love the premise of the show. A space western with a rag tag group of bounty hunters exploring the solar system is done amazingly well. The potential a
                  show like that has is utilizes every aspect of it's world here. Each plot, while not really connected to each other, fully explores the concepts set up and gives plenty of opportunities to build character.
Speaking of which, I found myself falling in love with every character. Each one of them is defined by their past and we get to explore that, understanding how these characters got to where they are by the time of the show. The amount of great character building is mind blowing and left me immensely satisfied. The characters at their core aren't that complex, but get fleshed out as the series carries on, giving us their perspectives, and allowing the world to become more three dimensional. From the first episode, these characters are relatable in their motives and actions, and yet we see them do things quite literally out of this world. I found myself becoming emotionally invested in each character, and found each character moment great. 
On that topic, I should talk about the writing. Each episode, while separate from each other, only works in the show's favor. We see more and more of this universe and the people inside of it. While conceptually, this seems far out, the show does a fantastic job at grounding everything and making it feel realistic in a lot of ways. For example, Jet passing Spike a cigarette using zero gravity. While very minor, it's a moment I love because it makes sense in context of the world. It feels like the characters have lived here and know everything about the world, like we're just looking at a moment.
The plot of each episode is also very tight and well done. The stories are short, but wrap up in a satisfying way at the end of each episode. It never feels rushed, and instead feels like each action in the episode lead to a natural conclusion. We get to see a few characters and locations get explored and by the end, there are no loose threads. Because of that, each episode is wholly focused on making our characters consistent and our plot logical. That is the show's best strength. Giving us an interesting concept with a logical plotline. Our characters act completely in character, and make decisions that follow that. Because of that, we get satisfying payoffs because of the logical through line.
I'd be remiss not to mention the music. Every single song underscores the action perfectly, and gets us in the mood of the scene. The theme alone gets this section a ten, but every other song is great too. 
One other thing I love is the animation, It's amazingly expressive for the characters. I found myself looking at shots a few times to see all of the character's reactions simply because of the entertainment I'd get seeing how creative the animators got at expressing emotion. The settings also look phenomenal. Each cityscape and planet feel lived in and full of character. Some of them would make great wallpapers simply from how much is in them. 
So, now that I've got my thoughts out, do I think this show is good? Absolutely. It's the best anime I've had the pleasure of seeing with some of the best characters in media period. The setting alone got me hooked, but I stayed for the character interactions and tight plotlines. I'd highly recommend watching it and, if it's been a few years, watch it again.

Cowboy Bebop is something I grew up with my Dad and I have a sentimental bond to it. Ever since I was a baby my dad would play the OST in the car and I just became very attached to it since. Fast forward when I'm 14, I watched it for the first time and immediately fell in love with the anime.
This only strengthened my emotional bond with the anime. As it reminds me of my Dad and our bond together, and also my early childhood as it
                  brings so much nostalgia. The OST my Dad introduced to me from the beginning is the reason why I fell in love with jazz music and big band concerts. Also the reason why I got into music in general.

                Cowboy Bebop was like one of the original anime to come on adult swim back in the early 2000s. It basically was the pioneer of anime to get me into anime, but that was probably yu yu hakusho. But, anyway, that's a different anime entirely. I loved the non-stop action that cowboy bebop is just as I thought it would be, packed with action and with some additional added comedy, it makes for the semi-perfect anime with at first confusing backstory of all the main characters, at least that's what I thought while first watching it. But, it slowly sucks you in, you know, kinda
                  like a black hole or whatever. I enjoyed it, but I cannot say the same for others. But, what I like most is the graphics I miss how these types of graphics used to be.

                Cowboy Bebop is one of my favorite anime and still to this day one of the only anime titles that I can rewatch consistently and never get tired of.  The artwork is fantastic, the english dubbing on it is quite possibly one of the best to ever do it, the soundtrack is second to none, the entirety of the show isn't too long or short and the story is amazing.  The rag tag crew of bounty hunters has been done a thousand times but this feels different and feels real.  It feels like so many genres melded into one.   Scenes
                  transition from laugh out loud comedy, gritty action, to soul crushing sadness making sure you can relate as we experience all of this in our day to days.  I feel it's almost a commentary on loneliness at times based on all of the characters.  No love, no identity, no parents.  All forced to come together as a family but destined to break apart.  There is no filler but episodes like Toys in the Attic  where something is hunting the crew provide an interesting transition from some of the hard hitting themes and thus the order of the episodes is crafted brilliantly.",10,GoogleGangsta,

                Cowboy Bebop is one of those classics that everyone talks about. The perfect ""gateway anime"" that gives you an idea of some of the fun to be had in this weird and wonderful medium.
The first thing to blow me away about Bebop is just the sheer quality in nearly every aspect of it's production. From the well-developed, likable-yet-flawed characters, jazzy foot-tapping music and beautifully gritty animation, all the way to the inventiveness of the stories concocted for each individual ""session"". 
Some things that are important to know before going in: While the show is told in a linear way, this is very much an anthology
                  series. The majority of the episodes are stand-alone, with only a few connecting into an over-arching story. If you go into this expecting a long, brilliantly-told story over 26 episodes (like me) you will be disappointed. Most of the episodes work as stand-alone stories, with the main cast rarely bringing up prior events.
Despite this, each session brings with it a new and exciting story that pays homage to one genre or another, the love of which the creators express with full granduer.
Another thing. The cast, making up the crew of the Bebop, don't change much throughout the series. They don't overcome their individual flaws and ""progress"" like characters in other popular shows. This doesn't really matter though, as each of the crew are charismatic and effortlessly cool in their own way and watching them bounce off each other is a joy to behold. 
While I won't say much on the last few episodes to allow viewers to go in as blind as possible, (this is a *very* spoilable show) I will say that the ending is brilliantly executed and will stick with you long after the final credits have rolled.

                A western (in the cowboy sense) with a metric boat load of western elements (in the European sense). Watching this in dub would have certainly emphasised this element of the anime for me, but this was fine by me. This is a great homage to Westerns, Film Noir, and all of the other genres they decided to blend together to make this fantastic show.
The world, or should I say universe, set in the near future with space colonization and a desolate Earth, is pretty intriguing. I found myself googling about it a fair bit when watching the show, but I will admit it's a fairly
                  straightforward universe.
The story has an overarching plot which is slowly revealed in the process of the show. Whilst it comes off at times as a generic villain of the week show, there is more than meets the eye, and even if the villain doesn't relate to the main plot, it usually brings out elements of the main characters you haven't seen before. I suppose the second episode about the dog was kind of lame, but honestly I still enjoyed it a lot.
Spike, Jet Black, Faye Valentine, Edward and the dog all contribute well to the story, the first three in particular. The emotional depth to these characters is astonishing, even if the show is stingy with the details. It almost demands you to pay attention to get little tidbits of information, and by the end of the show you have what I would consider a satisfying fix on the characters. I like the conclusions of the story arcs these characters face, they are perfect in a sense.
This is all not to mention the damn catchy intro. And it just looks so aesthetically pleasing, and is such a ridiculously perfect fit for what the show is about. I'm glad they didn't swap the opening with another mid-way through the show, I'm assuming this was before the time anime creators decided to swap the intros to their shows every 12 episodes or so.
I think the only factors stopping this show from being perfect to me would be the occasional lackluster episodes, sometimes forgettable villain/characters of the week, and sometimes the slow pacing does get a little boring for my taste, even if it is done excellently most of the time. Also Edward was kinda eh and I think brevity in the show could have been added another way, or with a better character. But I found her origins and original locality very cool.
This is a must watch, not just for anime fans but I think fans of television, movies and other forms of media generally speaking. You need to see Cowboy Bebop, it's a strong 9/10 for me.",9,mr07,

                Cowboy Bebop is one of those special shows has risen beyond a limited audience to become a cultural icon, being incredibly popular not only with eastern audiences, but with western ones as well, thanks to the heavy inspiration it draws from western media and pop culture. Even after over two decades it has a dedicated cult following and is lauded as not only one of the greatest anime of all time, but one of the best TV shows in general. So, does Cowboy Bebop live up to its incredible reputation? My answer: Yes and no. 
Let's start with the basic premise of the show. Cowboy
                  Bebop is a sci-fi western, following the adventures of a ragtag group of bounty hunters that travel across space, trying to make a living for the future while dealing with their dark pasts. It is primarily episodic, with most episodes consist of the gang trying to nab a bounty while dealing with the problems and misadventures that are thrown their way. There is a bit of an overarching plot, but out of the 26 total episodes, only about 5 of them actually focus on it, at the beginning, middle, and very end. Each of the characters have their own individual stories that are gradually revealed over the course of the show, with each of them having a resolution by the end. Most episodic shows usually go down the slice-of-life/light-hearted route, so it's definitely interesting to see it done with a more serious setting and story. However, the real question is whether or not it truly works, and honestly, I don't think it does. 
The problem with Cowboy Bebop is that it has a lack of focus and originality. Many episodes simply consist of a random adventure the crew happens to bumble their way into, most of them lacking any kind of meaningful development or insight into the plot or any of the characters. What's more, there were many plot holes and inconsistencies, to the point where it got almost frustrating. Stakes and problems that would carry over between episodes were almost nonexistent. Many of these plotlines were basically ripped from lots of famous movies and TV shows as well, as it tries to pay homage to western media. Entire episodes could have been removed and there would have been zero impact to the overall experience. To be really blunt, a lot of it was simply boring and uninteresting. 
Most of the episodes that I DID enjoy were the ones that focused on the overarching story or at least had some kind of focus to them, such as giving more info about a character's past. However, they mostly took place in the second half of the show, and were outnumbered by the mediocre episodes. Out of 26 entire episodes, I would say I only truly enjoyed maybe 10 of them, and these were mostly in the second half of the show.
The frustrating thing is that the show is very good when it really tries to push things along, especially when it comes to the characters. While a bit tropey, they are genuinely interesting and well-written. The slow-burn pacing and revealing of their pasts gives the show a mysterious and compelling quality. The banter between them was one of the most enjoyable parts of the whole show. The fact that the show neatly wrapped their arcs together at the end makes the climactic conclusion even better. I also appreciated what it did thematically, as there's a great underlying message of moving on from the past and looking towards the future. 
Onto what's probably the best aspect of the show: the audio and visuals. For a 90's show, the animation is genuinely amazing and incredibly fluid. Action scenes are fast and dynamic, and there's a lot of great visual directing in general. The setting is incredibly unique and interesting, and is compounded by a very nice soundtrack. It creates a great aesthetic that almost makes the show worth watching purely for the spectacle of it. 
Ultimately, Cowboy Bebop is a show that has a lot of charm and objectively good qualities, but has many glaring flaws that really bog down the experience. It has great audio and visuals, and a truly interesting cast of characters, which are unfortunately subjected to mostly directionless and boring plotlines that make the show feel like a chore to watch. It's a bit painful, as I really feel that it was really hampered from being as good as it could have been. 
All that being said, I would still say that Cowboy Bebop is worth a watch. It's a genuinely unique experience that has something to appeal to everybody, especially if you're a fan of western media. Just try to appreciate it for visuals and characters, not for its story.",7,ceedot,

                Cowboy Bebop is one of the most appraised animes ever, people call it the best anime of all time, the best piece of media they have ever seen. Sure, it's nice, I liked it, it's enjoyable, it's pretty good if I must say, but extremely overrated.
Basically, Cowboy Bebop is from how I've understood it a slice of life that implemented a storyline within characters. And with it being a slice of life I can't rate it a 10, because the genre itself is undeserving of a 10 since it's purely for enjoyment. And now, the story was implemented... fine? Faye's stroy was amazing, I was
                  blown away by how well it was done, Jett's was great too, Ed's story almost wasn't there but it really wasn't a problem since Ed was purely comic relief, and here's where the problem comes. Spike's story was done really poorly. Faye had a progressing story that was extremely enjoyable and kept you hooked, while Spike was just randomly meeting vicious and doing nothing.
Characters were amazing, there were no one-dimensional characters, and Spike is definitely one of my favorite MC's, he's really charming. The episodes were pretty fun, the ideas were pretty creative and interesting.
So in conclusion: Cowboy Bebop is a great show that's worth watching, but it's overrated. It's a slice of life that tried implementing a story within characters and succeeded for the most part. So... just watch it, you won't regret it.",8,an1meb00bs,

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MANY SPOILERS
Watching Cowboy Bebop feels like drinking a nice cold beer after a hard day at work. You can just sit back and relax while watching octane-powered chases and action scenes along with great jazz music.
The story goes like this: we follow the misadventures of Spike Spiegel and Jet Black, broke bounty hunters aboard the Bebop in a futuristic sci-fi context. There is no complex plot to wrap your head around -- we naturally and effortlessly learn more about the past of our beloved main characters along the anime as they partner up with the amnesiac femme fatale Faye Valentine, orphan whiz
                  kid Radical Edward and the genetically-modified dog Ein.
Spike is our action man, a non-womanizing version of James Bond. His spontaneity and dry humor more than make up for his lack of flirting, though. A prolific thief with unparalleled agility, his weapons of choice are pistols and martial arts. Thankfully, his agility is no carte blanche for every challenge of his, as he often gets shot and hurt along the anime... his unpretentious walk always gets me. Contrasting with Spike, Jet is a behind the scenes techie who acts as support, identifies their next targets and makes sure every runs smoothly. Jet has a friend in every corner of galaxy, which makes viewers wonder about his past as the episodes advance.
Interestingly, the crew of the Bebop present a truly chaotic sense of justice, in the sense of D&D. Sometimes, they do not seem to care about, or even understand, the impact of their actions. Consequently, they downplay their role in the fate of humanity in galaxy.
Other times, their personal lives conflict with their pursuit of money, which leads to nice ethical dilemmas. This is the means through which we learn more about our beloved misfits. Since I chose not to care about how much I am spoiling here, why not reveal all my thoughts? The relation with the past is a major theme in Cowboy Bebop. The decisions and personal lives of the crew of the Bebop reveal different ways to deal with the past: we may run from it, we may chase it, we may be forced to face it or perhaps we may want to chase it -- yet it might not explain the present anymore!
The icing on the cake is the ambiance of Cowboy Bebop. There is zero political correctness -- cigarettes and drug trafficking are all over the place, exactly as they were in wild west movies. Gory scenes are always to be expected... and even ones which hint at sex. Maybe I am just too used to western-style clean movies, yet it is just refreshing to see an anime which does not try to hide it all. At first, it seemed to me that the sexual tension with Faye was underplayed. On a second moment, I realize it was better like this: the ""born sexy yesterday"" trope is already present on Faye Valentine -- an emphasis on sexual tension with her would inevitably lead to boob jokes or male-centered fan-service. (so kudos to the producers for not having fallen in such pitfall)
For a sci-fi anime, the incoherent mix of technologies used by the characters would feel contradictory -- maybe even nonsensical -- if noticed anywhere else: pistols and machine-guns are the weapons of choice, while we see more futuristic guns in spaceships and occasional missile launchers. If there is anything sacred here, it is its aesthetics: this anachronic mix is dosed gracefully as to the cultural significance certain guns are endowed with. This seemingly incoherent mix... it just works. As for the revolvers, this is an anime about (space) cowboys, after all...
The way I look at it, Cowboy Bebop is a must-see for any otaku young and old, period. Why restrict it to otakus? It simply is a must-see. It contains iconic scenes of anime as a genre, pays homage to several pop-culture icons and references classical scenes of movies.
To finish, Cowboy Bebop has earned its legendary status without relying on a 2deep4u plot crutch justification. To be fair, Cowboy Bebop is not just a nice cold beer. It is a fine whisky.",10,gpr9,

                Cowboy Bebop is one of those series that is just impossible to criticize, it has fans who will defend it. And I think that's okay, because this anime is masterpiece.
We follow two bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet, who own a ship called the Bebop. They travel the Solar system, chasing wanted criminals to earn money. In later episodes they pick up 2 women. Faye Valentine and computer genius Edward (yes, Edward is female).
Each episode brings about a new bounty which they chase after.
Animation for 90s anime is amazing, the detail put into backgrounds and surroundings is great.

                Cowboy Bebop is a good anime, with incredible animation, even more for the time it was made and the soundtrack is just fantastic.
It's an episodic anime, that is, each episode is a different story, that makes 6 or 7 episodes really important (I'm not saying that the other episodes are bad). The development of the characters is very simple, it tells you the basics of the characters, it makes it look like at the end of the anime that you still don't know the characters.
The construction of the world is very good, it is indeed a very interesting universe and it seems to be cool
                  to live there.
The anime also deals with very interesting philosophical subjects
It has a good timing of humor and the ending is good

                This anime is in that realm of if you watch anime AT ALL, you have seen this. Especially if you were born between 1980 and 1990. This show was on Adult Swim along with Fullmetal and Trigun. It was the first anime that I watched that I truly felt was something special. Like, I felt cool watching it. If I told someone I watched it, they wouldn't think I was a weird weeby nerd in highschool. At that time in most peoples lives, what others thought about you was perceived to be important. It will always be one of my favorite anime ever made.
To
                  be honest, this show isn't one I would recommend to someone for their first anime. The animation was absolutely stellar for its time, but like most other anime, it hasn't really aged that well. It's still good, but I would hold this one until you have had a few other shows first. This one is for the cultured that want to hear a creative music score in an intro, enjoyed Firefly, and love the idea of the wild west in space.

                Hey there, i wanted to share my thoughts on this anime, i have to tell that my english isn't thaat good so there may be mistakes. I will divide this review from the best aspects to the ""worst"", if there is any.
Sound and OST (10/10) : What can i say about the OST, it's truly breathtaking. It's principally jazz and blues, and ocasionally other genres like metal or pop rock. This soundtrack success at making a moment not that amazing into a hole audiovisual experience.
Art (9/10) : I think the animation of CP it's incredible for 1998, specially the action scenes are wonderful. The enviroments
                  are beautiful, i like most of the character desings but i find it quite simple and not that atractives for my perception.
Character (8/10) : I actually loved the principal characters of the series, i have no complains about them, Spike being a person escaping from his past, love the Valentine's identity crisis and his resolution, Jet's backstory is quite enjoyable, Ed... well, she's just a child and there's not that much to say about her. But i have a little problem with some secondary characters, some of them aren't interesting at all and feel like filler characters. I'm specially talking about Abdul, Morgan, Maria, Mao, remember them? Yup, me neither.
Story (7/10) : Well, this may be an unpopular opinion, but let's get to it. Cowboy Bebop it's about the past, how it afects us, and how we deal with it, the story it's mainly about telling us little by little the past of the principal cast, throwing to us some facts about out characters in different ""missions"" and sub-plots. The only episodes that are only about Spike, it's the two last ones, and honestly, they're perfect and beautiful in all ways. But this anime is an episodic series, and that's, in my opinion, where the problem is, let me explain. Half of the episodes feels pointless, they are not telling us nothing about our characters, it just relays in subplots, some times they're really good, like the sect one, or reaaaally pointless and boring, this is really a hit or miss. I would give Cowboy Beebop a 10 if it all of those subplots were actually good.
Anyways, this anime is a ""must watch"", do not personally think of it as a masterpiece, but when it's good, IT'S REALLY GOOD. I recommend to watch it slowly and not swallow it in one sitting, because you may get a wrong idea of what CP is.",8,ginozega8,
1,"
                I do not give 10's lightly. However... sometimes, if I'm lucky, something comes along that changes me in a profound and special way. It comes in like a flash of lightning, and you know something will always be different once its gone. 
I originally added this to my ""classics watchlist"" at the beginning of quarantine last year. I knew it was beloved by anime veterans, but I know that a lot of the classics don't always hold up to new audiences. I've fallen for that trap in the past, and it's always frustrating when a well-loved show ends up falling flat after all the hype
                  I hear about it. However, Cowboy Bebop surprised me in one very important way: it lived up to my expectations, but did so in its own way. It wasn't what I was expecting, not even a little bit, but it now has a very special place in my heart.
At first glance, the art is definitely rough around the edges and has that ""90's anime vibe"", but the motion is fluid and the fight choreography tight and exciting to watch. You can tell a lot about each character by how they move and throw punches, which says a lot about the art direction and the skill of the animators. 
The music is godlike. Yoko Konno & The Seatbelts are legends for a reason, and I adore the western twang mixed with synthetic sounds and funky jazz. Every scene is immediately improved the moment the OST kicks in, and I doubt I would have loved this show as much as I do without their compositions. I suggest looking up ""Too Good Too Bad"" or ""NY Rush"" if you want a good taste.
Typically I am not a fan of episodic shows. I love epic sagas and self-contained slice of life stories with a clear rising action and resolution. As with most episodic shows, not every single episode was a winner for me However, Cowboy Bebop uses those episodic adventures to pour all of its love and attention into fleshing out its characters. 
And oh, what characters they are. This is the element that really takes center stage here: the character work is godlike. Then, when you slip into an uneasy feeling of affection for these people, the story roars in again at full throttle. I put it this way to a friend after finishing the how for the first time: By spending most of the show's runtime focused on their individual characters, the story can unfold without wasting any time.
This show is moody, depressing, and also more than a bit edgy. But there are also some episodes in here that made me laugh harder than I had in ages. This was the perfect quarantine companion for me, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loves character-driven stories and classic sci-fi space-opera's.",10,SnicksG,

Cowboy Bebop is about the life of average bounty hunters who have adventures around different planets and places in space, it is a very fun journey in which you learn more about the characters. which are endearing, are well developed throughout the plot and leave you wanting to know more about them.
This series touches on some rather philosophical and self-retrospective themes about the characters' past lives, each and every one of the protagonists has a past that they cannot let go, that haunts them to this day and that have an impact on both personal level as plot.
The development of the series is in an
                  episodic format, but every so often there will be small linear plots with respect to the protagonist.
It is a series that I highly recommend, it has a great soundtrack and a very fluid animation for action moments, the characters are fun, they have interesting interactions with the rest and the development of the story is great, it tells the story in a very subtle way and you have to tie loose ends, if you liked everything I told you before you should see Cowboy Bebop.
Cowboy Bebop trata de la vida de unos caza recompensas promedio que tienen aventuras por distintos planetas y lugares del espacio, es un viaje muy divertido en el cual aprendes mas de los personajes. los cuales son entrañables, son bien desarrollados a la larga de la trama y te dejan con ganas de saber mas sobre ellos.
Esta serie toca algunos temas mas bien filosóficos y auto retrospectivos sobre la vida pasada de los personajes, todos y cada uno de los protagonistas tienen un pasado que no pueden dejar ir, que los atormenta hasta el día de hoy y que tienen un impacto tanto a nivel personal como argumental.
El desarrollo de la serie es en un formato episódico, pero cada tanto van a haber pequeñas tramas lineales con respecto al protagonista.
Es una serie que recomiendo mucho, tiene una gran banda sonora y una animación muy fluida para los momentos de acción, los personajes son divertidos, tienen interacciones interesantes con el resto y el desarrollo de la historia es genial, cuenta la historia de manera muy sutil y tienes que atar cabos sueltos, si todo lo previo que te conté te gusto deberías ver Cowboy Bebop.

1,"
                lutôt disappointed by this series which is correct but does not deserve its place in the Top 111.
The main fault is a very flat scenario. Almost all episodes are interchangeable because there is no progression. The characters evolve very little. Here is for example the plot of an episode: the hero falls by chance on a psychopathic killer. The hero manages to escape. The killer invites the hero to find him to finish. The hero accepts and kills the psychopath a little by chance. End of the episode.
It remains of course that the music, the action scenes and the universe are really cool. But the
                  Space Cowboy deserved better stories.
Or I play devil’s advocate and I say that the message of the show is that in a world devoid of meaning and values, there remains the quest for food (a leitmotiv of the characters) and the cool of space gunfights.
See you, Space Cowboy",7,Heymateur,
1,"
                Such an incredible anime. Every character is extremely well developed throughout the course of the short 1 season, as the mystery of each individual past is slowly unveiled in a cryptic, fragmented way that keeps you guessing. Spike, Jet, and Faye all have very interesting and different character designs, and the mystery that the show envelops their origins in is truly captivating.
What truly steals the show for me, though, are the episodes where Spike and Vicious clash; the two feel so different yet similar. The settings and atmosphere of these episodes are extremely memorable as well, as the church where their first fight occurs and
                  the snowy, cold landscape (in which spike changes his wardrobe for the only time) are two of the most memorable motifs in the entire run. The Red Dragons have such an interesting power dynamic that becomes revealed near the end, and Julia's effect on Spike develops his character even more: from careless and detached to emotionally numb due to his troubled past.
The ending is truly shocking and abrupt but is beautiful and a great conclusion to the tale. Spike being killed after slaying everyone who caused his past trauma is very dark but fitting. In the end, everyone takes their new family and home for granted and chases old things that aren't coming back.
The visuals and soundtrack build a complete and captivating world in only twenty-something episodes, which is a feat in itself. The gorgeous 90s style artwork and animation are perfectly complemented by what is in my opinion the greatest soundtrack that I've encountered thus far in any form of Television or film. The blues and jazz influences make for some incredibly memorable sequences and really enhance the atmosphere and emotional beats.

                Cowboy bebop is a western-inspired anime series and probably one of the first anime to come to your mind when you think of classic. 
The story is simple enough, we have our group Faye, Spike, Jet, Ed and Ein who are bounty hunters in 2071. This is an episodic anime which means some episodes might or might not have some relation between them but each one is just about hunting a bounty-holder. Do not expect much plot, as much of the series is just hunting people, dialogue and story. These kinds of anime tend to get horrendously boring and repetitive but cowboy bebop managed to
                  make 26 original and fun episodes. The dialogue is just amazing, I loved the quotes and way of talking too. The anime is also pretty groundbreaking for 1999, with lots of homosexual characters, tons of black ones and overall a pretty revolutionary anime with lots of messages and comedy. The story is a 9
This anime aired in 1998-1999, the quality is quite good for that time. Not only is the anime really crisp but the quality of the art also is pretty good. The animation is smooth and all the characters look great. The anime had some fanservice too which is always helpful. 9/10
The op of the series is tank. You must have heard of it from some friend or seen it in a top anime op list. Tbh it is not THAT good, it is iconic and the song on the background is pretty cool but there are no voices except from the very start and it isn't that good overall, pretty overrated, would say it is an 8.5/10, there are 3 endings for the series.	First, ""The Real Folk Blues"". Pretty fine song and visuals 8.
Secondly ""Space Lion"" (ep 13) not that great, it looks fine but the song is not too good 7/10. Third is ""Blue"" (ep 26), pretty average too 7/10. The voice acting is great. Sound is an 8/10
The characters of this anime have non matching personalities but they all fit together somehow, they all have their cool pasts and stories to tell. Each one has their charisma and good points. Just like the anime, these are some classic and iconic characters. Would say 9/10
I enjoyed watching Cowboy Bebop quite a bit, it was packed with jokes, interesting characters, good writing, cool and sentimental story and overall high quality and effort production. 
Even then, it did have some flaws like not having enough plot and not all episodes were 10/10, some were just fine or great. For these reasons I must give Cowboy Bebop a 9/10 (9.5).",9,Alex_Jaro,
1,"
                Cowboy Bebop feels like Avatar the Last Airbender. I have never watched Avatar the Last Airbender, but I know it is about a million episodes long. This kind of structure lets you make a bunch of nonsense filler episodes and then have a few episodes of plot, and you can take as much time as you want to flesh all of the characters out. Cowboy Bebop is where you follow that formula exactly, but you try to do it in 26 episodes rather than 100. 
As I am writing this I am tempted to dock it because Cowboy Bebop doesn't really have a story, certainly
                  not an engaging one. There is a love interest, and she is never developed meaningfully at all. The love interest is only developed by you being repeatedly told she is a love interest. In fact, Cowboy Bebop's approach to storytelling is mostly ""This is what is happening."" Practically every episode is a new character, a new plot, and it is compressed into a tiny little blurb that doesn't say much in the end. There isn't any room for subtlety in this story. Things just happen, and you just kind of have to accept them. They aren't well-developed, and they won't become well-developed later.
No one has clear motivations, or really any motivations. 
Cowboy Bebop is pretty though. It isn't extremely well-animated, but it is incredibly beautiful at times. Probably the most beautiful anime I have ever seen. The characters are pretty too: they are all very likable. Again, they don't have very much character, but if you take liberties you can imagine quite a lot to them, and the little bits they do have are quite nice if you look at them in the right light. This is similarly why I gave the story such a high score even though it is very lacking in structure/substance: it is a pretty story too. The universe of Cowboy Bebop is interesting, and the things they are going to do are interesting. The writers didn't write anything stupid; they just didn't write anything special. Basically, if you don't really care for story but need at least an honest attempt, Cowboy Bebop could very well be a perfect ten for you.
Here is some extra review:
Cowboy Bebop's music is okay. I don't care for jazz, so the whole ""It's so different and jazzy"" thing is totally lost on me. It is good and nice, but is often awkwardly bombastic at times. I didn't really care for the endings of every episode. Not even really foreshadowing as much as its just blunt and overbearing.

                This was from an Era of the 90s its easily one of the best shows ever I will have to say from the designers and all this was a great show that tapped into variety of characters these characters were Faye,Ed,Jet and Also Spike I still cherish the production being over 20 years old this anime is a classic anime if you love action well this one should be considered the voices are also fantastic they match each character quite well... :) the English voices give them the uniqueness to each character so I appreciate that with the art style and voice work as well

                Wow where do I even start...
Cowboy Bebop was an anime that I was very prejudiced about because I don't like neither space nor old animes. I hate space theme I didn't even watch Star Wars. If you ask why I don't like old animes. It's simply because the animations dont buy me most of the time. But this anime was an exception I wasn't ready for...
Story: (10/10)
Cowboy Bebop is about a crew of bounty hunters in space, it takes place in year 2071. Crew is first found by Jet Black and Spike Spiegel and as time goes on new people join. They are living a
                  hard life sometimes not being able to eat anything for days. They are trying to survive and have fun along the way. In  this show every character has their own story. They are going through their own hardships in their minds and lives. 
The series has an episodic form which I normally hate but again this show is such an exception.
Characters: (10/10)
Cowboy Bebop sold itself to me when I saw that classic scene of Spike Spiegel ""Whatever happens, happens."" I love carefree characters because I feel closer to them. Spike is one of the most carefree characters you'll see in anime world this trait most of the time makes him the funniest guy on the squad. But as series goes on you see what Spike gone and goes through, what his goal in life is and you love every second he is on screen.
Ship's leader, Jet Black is a man of duty. He is an old cop that left the job after realising the cops were getting corrupt. He then gone on to be a bounty hunter meeting Spike on the way and taking him to his ship Bebop. He is the leader and father of the group, he always does his best to keep everyone together whilst going through his problems.
Faye, the arrogant woman of the ship as Spike says. She seems like a loose bomb doing whatever she wants, coming and going out the ship without giving any notice most of the time and she is a gold digger. Everything is in place to hate her. But you can't, you just can't. Her character developement is amazing, you see her getting more and more connected to the crew and seeing the crew as her family. 
Ed, The genius kid. She is definitely the funniest girl in the crew. She is a genius hacker that can get into anything and everything. When you see her on screen you start smiling immidieatly because her character is so likeable and so childlike in such a cruel world that you love it.
Ein, The data dog. Well Ein is the smartest dog. I'd love to talk more about Ein but to be honest it doesn't really add much to story as it's a dog and I don't wanna bore you. So moving on!
There are more characters to talk about that are very well designed indeed but I'm trying my best to make this as spoiler-free as possible so I reccomend you watch the show and see the other characters first hand.
Sound: (10/10)
I never really cared about music in anime not gonna lie. But this anime raised my expectations of music in anime so high... After finishing the show I added 12 of the soundtracks to my spotify. I've never done something like that before in my life. Music is such an amazing part of this anime I don't think words will be enough to describe.
Art: (10/10)
This anime was made in 1998. And it's animation quality is on par with todays. The fighting scenes are amazing, the scenery, the cinematography. It's so beautiful that most of the time  I felt like I was watching a movie. The dark tone of the anime matches the problems characters are going through and fits the anime perfectly.
Overall: (10/10)
I doubt I'll give anything other than Death Note and Cowboy Bebop a 10/10. It's a masterpiece in my opinion but at worst it's still a must watch show. Hope you liked my review!",10,BenBerkeKaraca,

                Cowboy Bebop is an old anime set in the distant future where interplanetary travel is possible. The plot focuses on the adventures of a group of space bounty hunters who are completing missions (some successful and others not so much).
Most episodes tend to be self-contained and don't develop the characters until the final chapters.
My opinion:
Plot → I don't usually like anime whose plot doesn't progress in a linear fashion. Until the final chapters nothing interesting happens.
Setting → I don't really like science fiction or the futuristic either
Characters → Although they are objectively well written, their development does not occur until almost the end of the
                  work, where they explain their origins.
Conclusion: In general, it was a boring anime for me, since it gives the feeling that there is no interesting plot to follow. The highlight is the past of the characters, but this is not explained until the last chapters. If the beginning of a series doesn't grab you, it's hard to get to the end to discover the true potential of this work.
Final score: 7",7,DeividK3,

                Needless to say, Cowboy Bebop is one of the classics. The show is much ahead of its time, unaffected by the generation gap. It is set in a futuristic backdrop where the Earth has become kind of a junkyard and humanity is not restricted to a single planet.
Spike Spiegel and Jet Black are partners in such an environment, who make their living by hunting bounties, like space cowboys. This is one interesting oxymoron as it brings together the two opposing concepts of western countryside cowboys chasing after criminals across the galaxy, riding their spaceships. Each episode brings to us a new adventure that takes Spike
                  and Jet after a new bounty, picking up the other crew members on the way- Ein (the doggo), Edward (the kid), and Fay Valentine. Though it may not be the perfect team with perfect coordination, each member has a unique role to play, that brings them together…or maybe not, but hey, that’s what makes it different and interesting to watch!
We see information from the characters’ past, spread unevenly in bits and pieces, which starts to make sense as the story progresses. The characters are given depth, instead of portraying them as the typical tsundere or the undefeated fighting master.
Considering the late 90s, the art is amazing and appeals to the aesthetic sense which was the first thing that compelled me to watch this show.
The antagonist arc was not too strong, but in the end, it was not about defeating the last boss or a happily ever after; it was all about the friends we made along the way! 😊

                Here it is, the big kahuna. The single anime many believe to be the best ever made, topping list after list that I've seen. Finally, I get around to watching it and oh my god.
The blues is such a perfect soundtrack in keeping with the pace of the show. The characters, flushed out slowly and brilliantly, never learning too much about one character until the right moment. The plot, keeping you entertained while slowly building up the setting and people in it. The animation, looking absolutely stellar for the time. The dub voice actors, which many believe to be the superior version in this case,
                  conveying emotion and always this underlying mysteriousness. It all combines to become an absolute blast to watch.
I fell in love in the first 10 minutes, the show hooking me instantaneously. If I could have a favorite character, it would most likely be Edward since she is one wacky girl and absolutely hysterical. The plot continued to evolve, teaching important lessons along the way until the pulse-pounding conclusion that will leave you just speechless. I knew many of the plot spoilers going into it, but the show was still enjoyable to watch nonetheless.

                What can I say, it is a work that when you start you do not know what you will see, at least it was my case. Everything that he poses to us in each episode he does in a sublime way, they took the time to develop each element such as the environment and its characters. With the music used I am not very familiar with it, sometimes there are scenes that needed some background, but it is just a whim of mine,
There are also in scenes that silence symbolizes a lot while we see a panoramic view of the characters talking. My favorite character,
                  I can say that I like everyone, everyone contributes what is necessary and I really like the main group when they work together. and it is simply a series that I would see again.",10,JuanDi_09,

                Cowboy bebop focuses mainly on animation and soundtrack but that's what makes it special.
animation and soundtrack are just wonderful, bold, unique, evocative. Both fit perfectly despite being from 2 different worlds. Probably if you only listened to the soundtrack without seeing the anime you would have a completely different idea of the anime environment. If you read the cowboy bebop manga without seeing the anime there is little chance of guessing the background of the soundtrack. they are without a doubt its strongest point and for that in my opinion is already a good reason to give this anime a chance.
Another strong point are the
                  characters, and I'm not talking about their past, their experiences, etc. I'm talking about the characters themselves, the way they are portrayed,s, the essence of their being that leads you to know what their next adventure will be even in the leastgood episodes. You know that if you were part of their group you wouldn't spend a dull moment and you'd feel like you're in a family, a family that has been consolidated episode after episode, a family shaped by Jet as a sort of father figure, Faye as the daughter in her moment of rebellion, Spike as the mysterious son who doesn't keep to himself and you don't know what he's thinking and Ed as the little sister playing with the sweet Ein.
Together they have their funny, action, cool, sad and even boring moments but you're ready to forgive them that maybe in some episodes they didn't give you your dose of coolness because you're simply won over by their substance, kind of like when you keep being in love with an attractive person even though they've hurt you.
However If we penetrate more into the anime structure and the characther’s pasts we find some flaws that I can no longer overlook.
Cowboy Bebop is an anime made up of almost all indipendent episodes that illustrate the story of our bounty hunters chasing bad guys for money and failing maybe more than half the time. These episodes are some good, some average and some just plain bad.
Only a few episodes try to make a fixed thread every now and then scattered in the rest of the independent episodes telling the past of the 4 main characters.
Obviously I preferred this kind of episodes compared to the ""filler"" ones even if Jet's plot doesn't ring a bell to me. I like the character but only that.
Ed's past was good and yet the anime only devotes 3 episodes to her I think they are well constructed. The first 2 moments of Ed in the spotlight are pretty funny. I especially like how the music, the vibes, the whole atmosphere of the anime change when this character becomes the main character for 20 minutes. It's as if Ed's entire personality has influenced the events happening around her. Her third to last dedicatory episode as well as the third to last of the anime is just heartbreaking....
Spike's moments have the best action scenes although these are constant throughout the anime; the animation and soundtrack are breathtaking especially in these scenes. With Spike the anime introduces us to, let's say the main villain although I dare say an average villain. He's just typical white-haired guy who used to be the main character's best friend but for some reason now they want to kill each other. Sort of like Griffiht (or if you prefer Ryou Asuka) but boring. Eventually, in the last episode, Spike's story descends into an average revenge story.
Faye's past is the most interesting and in which I showed more interest because it had more complex and more intriguing puzzles. Another point to its advantage is that the pursuit of her goal seems more human, more natural, so that in a way you feel in Faey's shoes. Certainly not on such a tragic scale, but haven't you ever felt moved when you return to a place you haven't been for years?
The problem with Spike and Faye's stories is that they tried to be deep, but the inconsistency with which both are told ruins everything. The anime doesn't give them enough time to develop into strong, deep stories.
I know it's an episode/character driven show, less about the plot and more about the cool stuff happenning, but there are anime like The Great Pretender, which has a very similar structure to Cowboy Bebop, that is more concerned about its characters, their development, and makes us understand more about the motivations for their actions and decisions.
well, despite its flaws cowboy bebop is an experience not to be missed for its creativity and the audacity to try something exclusive and uncommon audiovisually.",8,shaimi,

                Cowboy Bebop is in the unique situation of being a bit too immature to be considered a Seinen, yet just dramatic enough to be considered a really great Shonen at the same time. Despite the fact that the narrative on the surface is rather straightforward, the anime's characters are what actually carry the program. In terms of introducing the characters, the program does an excellent job without resorting to exposition. As a result, we, as an audience that has invested in the program, are interested in seeing where these characters end up in the future. In order to keep the story from becoming imbalanced, each
                  character that is subsequently introduced has their own moment to shine in the spotlight. Even though the anime's plot twists and turns towards the finish, it is worth the viewer's time to see it through to the end. The anime does an excellent job of not taking itself too seriously, resulting in a number of hilarious moments that do not detract from the overall tone of Doom. It results in a program that is both fascinating and entertaining to watch.",10,Perfumedpenguin,

                Everything was outstanding except the story. Although it is still great, it just isn't that explained. Like nobody says a thing about what you see less then one second but it still is important. If you watch with a lot of attention you will understand it but I still belief  it could have been better. The ending is very good and I am happy with it. As for the characters it's a 10. Everyone is just interesting and all have their backstories and different relations to each other. This is for sure a must watch, if you don't like the old anime style or
                  the smaller frame, you should still try.",10,Koroshi123,

I was still in my tens when this anime came out. When I was becoming more interested in anime, this title was in my watch list. I'm glad I did not pressed the play button for this back then.
This anime is like whisky. Because you need to let it age to flavour the peak of a perfect taste. I have known this anime for a long time, but back then I knew what I needed to do. I literally waited until I was just old enough to watch this.
I waited until I developed a good palate with the recollections
                  that real life has to offer.
Now, when I started this, for every single episode I watched, I was literally reminiscing many things in my life. That's why I couldn't binge watch this. There was more in the story that I took a weekly basis to complete this. Watching this felt like looking at an old album of photos. Every picture you see is full of feelings and thoughts. The philosophical standpoint of this title is made like that. The tone, the music, the art, the whole development will make you feel real folk blues. I can't express it in other way. 
My final recommendation, for everyone out there that have accumulated enough years on pressing the flesh and trailing the town streets, just don't grow old enough without watching this masterpiece.",10,sougo_13,

                rare shows come along such as this that manage to deftly balance sincere deconstruction of their genre while simultaneously reveling in the bombast of their unique vision and interpretation. what hasn't been said about bebop that hasn't already been said about the show for decades at this point? it maybe plays a little too fast and loose in it's stereotypes, if you look at it from a distance, but always treats it's characters with a baseline humanity most of it's contemporaries lack. masterpiece of a show. an absolute watermark in animation, sound tracking & character drama. the kinda thing you just need in your life.

                Part of me feels like reviewing a show like 'Cowboy Bebop' is a little redundant. I'm well aware I'm very late to the game with this show, I've been watching anime for, I'd imagine, 7/8 years now, and I'm only just watching it now. And that means that I can't avoid feeling a little like everything that could be said about this show has been said. But I do still feel like I want to talk about some of my thoughts (others I'll have to keep for arenas without rules against spoilers).
Obviously, this show is pretty incredible. The tone and world is like nothing else
                  in anime, perhaps anything else in storytelling, the characters are iconic beginning to end. The animation still looks fantastic by modern standards, Yoko Kanno's soundtrack is one of the all-time greats, the direction is artistically charged whether the story is taking us to its dramatic extremes or just sitting with the characters eating. Each episode feels unique and precisely put together, and pretty much every one of them turns out near perfectly. 
The idea of this show as 'space jazz', in contrast with a Space Opera, feels incredibly apt and somehow manages to make perfect sense; the almost free-form storytelling, off-beat yet incredibly coherent. It's like nothing else out there. 
Honestly, I went through most of this show entirely expecting it to hit the right beats for me to brand it a 9/10, one of my all-time favourite shows. As you can see, I haven't. Because, and this isn't the first time this happened for me, I just... I didn't quite click with the ending. The ending isn't unearned, by any stretch; this isn't a 'Revolutionary Girl Utena' situation, where the ending felt SO dissonant to the rest of the story, to the point where it actively ruined the show's message. I can't say the way things pan out aren't consistent, aren't earned, that the show isn't playing totally fair. But I still can't help but wonder what to take from the ending. At end of the day, good or bad, I think a good ending needs to put the character's journey out in front of them, show the audience how they've changed and developed over the story. That definitely doesn't have to be in a good way; I'm not here complaining about, like, MacBeth or Othello. But I like to at least feel like the things that happened mattered in the end. And, where this ending is concerned... I'm just not sure they did. I don't feel like the Spike Spiegel we say goodbye to in the final episode has meaningfully changed in any way. And that's a shame, because everything inbetween is SO good, so immaculately put together, so exciting and funny and resonant, that I feel it deserved more than the way things ended. 
And hey, maybe that's the point. The dissatisfaction, the muted tragedy, the anti-climax. I can certainly see readings where that has its own message in it. But I can't pretend that the final episode wasn't the first time in this series that I didn't come out of an episode feeling ultimately satisfied.
Again, thought, this isn't 'Revolutionary Girl Utena'. With that, my issues with the ending really did spoil my feelings on the show as a whole. I still had a phenomenal time watching 'Cowboy Bebop', I still loved the characters and the adventures and the stories told in this incredible world, and the ending does nothing to change that. I'm still incredibly glad I finally got to experience what really is one of the artistic heights of anime as a medium, and I'm glad it exists. So, while it may have not tipped itself over into that oh-so-rare 'nines' list, I still have to love this crazy ride.

Just an absolute masterpiece of a show. As much as I would've loved to see more with these characters, this story is so perfect that I don't mind. Spike is the perfect protagonist and the rest of the bebop crew fits in the series so well. One of my favorite shows in general of all time. And oh my god the soundtrack is just perfect. The opening theme to this show is
                  one of my favorite songs of all time its just perfect. The rest of the show is wonderfully scored with just the right track for every moment throughout the entire series. I can't seem to think of any flaws in this masterpiece.",10,harisk8888,

                See you again space cowboy….
Had the opportunity to watch the classic anime that is beloved by many.
The story is mostly through single episode adventure that showed Spike and his crew going through life collecting bounties. I definitely like the cool and chill vibe throughout the show. However, my problem is that I didn’t see a complete story that I could follow. I didn’t find a lot of thrills in many of the single episode. Still, there were still episodes that were exciting and made me think about the message of the show. There was an overarching story, but I would prefer that there were more
                  times dedicating to this main story.
Of course the best thing about this show was the music. The opening was for sure one the best. It was so cool and definitely got me excited. Then, the music within the show was just as dope and create a unique vibe to each episode. This reminds me a bit of Megalobox, which also has fun and variable genres of songs. 
The four main characters had great chemistry with each other and created comedic moments. They also each had interesting backstories, but the show revealed little, more like a quick glimpse, of each character, and I can’t help but desire more. Eh maybe that’s not the point of the show.
Overall, I enjoyed part of the show, mainly for its music and entertaining characters. 7/10",7,EDOSHINRATENSEI,

Cowboy Bebop... man this really is something. The main character (spike) is one of the greatest anime protagonists of all time, and Vicious fills all the checks a villain should have in an anime.

                Honest to God one of the best forms of media I've the pleasure to have witnessed. Let me start off with the story. The lack of a a continuous narrative, barring the 6 or Spike-orientated episodes which I'll touch on later, allows an episodic approach to a series. This works in Bebop's favor as each episode can be set on a different planet, allowing for fantastic world building and characterization. It also gives each episode something unique to it. Now, being a 90's anime the level of animation was nothing like it is today, but that is part of the charm of Bebop. It would
                  look off had it been re-animated and given modern effects. A benefit of the 90's style is that it allows Cowboy Bebop the opportunity to be what it wants. A space-western. That's the best I can describe it. Next up is sound. Sound...music. The soundtrack. Rain is a fantastic and haunting song with a guitar solo that fits the tone without removing from the song. The soundtrack by seatbelts is up with the Evangelion's and FLCL's as the best. Let me say this; Jazz is not easy to nail. Mix in a James Bond-like loop of horns and you've got TANK!, the second best opener (Evangelion is 1) of all time. Cosmos is great, Memory is melancholic yet nostalgic, and every track is fantastic, but the sound is above and beyond the time, most likely on par with something form the 2004-2008 era of sound design in anime, so needless to say, it to, is ahead of its time. Last we come to the Characters. Jet, my least favorite. He seems to be the calm to Spike's storm. Jet is by no means a bland character in the least, just I find the other cast more interesting. Jet seems to fill a stereotype at first but then we learn about his backstory and his... but that would be spoilers ;)... and he suddenly becomes this man we can empathize with and relate to his struggle. Next is Edward. Edward seems so out of place on this lonely and melancholic spaceship due to his... everything. His design is bright and cheerful compared to the washed out colors of the rest, and then his animation is also a lot more fluid-like, I guess. Ed brings Ein who could've been more developed. seriously. Then there's Faye who, to avoid spoilers I'll say this: she is heartbreaking. Spike is our fast talking master of fighting and seems to be the driving force of the Bebop. Saying anymore would likely get this review taken down again, but needless to say, Cowboy Bebop is a treasure. See you, Space Cowboy.",10,ThrowAwayBucket,

I would use my father's computer to access online forums in order to keep with the narrative, as watching two episodes a week was simply not enough.
